    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "- Used Scrapy to scrape the University of Westminster website.\n",
    "- Created two web spiders:\n",
    "  - One to find and extract all the links available in the sitemap.xml.\n",
    "  - Another to extract all the courses offered by the University of Westminster.\n",
    "- Extracted data included: Course URL, UK fees, international fees, course duration, and course description.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Issues:\n",
    "- The website blocked responses if too many requests were made in a short period.\n",
    "- Difficulty in saving the data in a properly structured format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mitigation:\n",
    "- Used fake request headers to bypass basic bot detection.\n",
    "- Implemented a delay to scrape only three web pages every three seconds, avoiding excessive request rates.\n",
    "- Saved all the extracted data in a CSV file, structured for future use."
