Accreditation in Canada To practise law in Canada, after completing your LLB degree in the UK you will need to demonstrate your competence to the National Committee on Accreditation (NCA). The NCA will assess your qualifications, taking into account your academic and professional background, and will make recommendations regarding further exams or legal education required. This will depend on how many steps towards qualifications in the UK have been taken (ie. LLB, LLB plus LPC/BVC, training contract) and the grades you have obtained. Upon successful completion of these requirements, the NCA will issue a Certificate of Qualification. The NCA does not assess individuals who wish to become members of Barreau du Québec or the Chambre des notaires du Québec . Studying Law at Westminster Westminster Law School has a long history of welcoming Canadian students to study with us in central London.

It encourages scholars working on the relationship between the spatial and social domains in architectural drawing, construction and beyond. Evans’ work interrogated the spaces that existed between drawing and building, geometry and architecture, teasing out the points of translation often overlooked. From his early work on prison design and domestic spaces, through to his later work on architectural geometry, Evans sought to articulate the multiple points at which the human imagination could influence architectural form. His first book, The Fabrication of Virtue, analysed the way that spatial layouts provided opportunities for social reform via their interference with morality, privacy and class. In The Projective Cast: Architecture and its Three Geometries, Evans traced the origins of the humanist tradition to understand how human form influenced architectural drawing and construction, focusing on aesthetic dimensions in the production of architectural space. This series will provide opportunities for the creation and/or dissemination of work by scholars working on similar questions of space, temporality, and architecture. In particular, it supports work that breaks the boundaries of traditional disciplines to think though these complex networks involved in the space between human imagination and architectural production.

Info: Join us for the launch of the much-anticipated Media and Communications Study Skills Guide by Doug Specht. Doug Specht will be introducing his new book through a light-hearted and amusing look at what it means to undertake a degree in Media and Communications, and university life more generally. Drawing upon his 15 years of teaching experience, Doug will take us beyond the pages of this book to bring us more amusing anecdotes and some unpleasant (and embarrassing) experiences, that might just also give the audience some ideas about how to study better – and there will plenty for those who have finished their studies too. Doug’s introduction will also take us through why he felt this book was needed and how it can help students at all levels get the most from their studies. His short talk will be followed by a reception and an opportunity to buy the book, signed by the author (if you wish). All the tips ideas and advice given to, and requested by, students in Media and Communications, are brought together in an easy-to-use accessible guide to help students study most effectively. Based upon many years of teaching study skills and hundreds of lecture slides and handouts it covers a range of general and generic skills that the author relates specifically towards media and communications. As well as the mechanics of writing and presentations the book also shows how students can work on and engage with the critical and contemplative elements of their degrees. Aimed primarily at postgraduate students, there is significant crossover with undergraduate dissertation writing, which would also make this book of use for upper level undergraduate work. UWP was set up to enable Westminster’s research community to further engage with the global open research agenda, to enhance the university’s research environment and provide for greater dissemination of impact in its key research areas.

Chair: Anastasia Kavada (University of Westminster) This groundbreaking collection advances understanding of the concept of media practices by critically interrogating its relevance for the study of citizen and activist media. has emerged as a powerful approach to understanding the media’s significance in contemporary society. Bringing together contributions from leading scholars in sociology, media and communication, social movement and critical data studies, this book stimulates dialogue across previously separate traditions of research on citizen and activist media practices and stakes out future directions for research in this burgeoning interdisciplinary field. Framed by a foreword by Nick Couldry and a substantial introductory chapter by the editors, contributions to the volume trace the roots and appropriations of the concept of media practice in Latin American communication theory; reflect on the relationship between activist agency and technological affordances; explore the relevance of the media practice approach for the study of media activism, including activism that takes media as its central object of struggle; and demonstrate the significance of the media practice approach for understanding processes of mediatization and datafication.

Title: "Back in the World" - Spiritual Wellbeing Series #1 | University of Westminster
Info: In October 2018, David Morris, the University of Westminster's Assistant Interfaith Adviser, began a nine-month residency at Gampo Abbey, a Buddhist monastery on the remote Cape Breton peninsula in Nova Scotia, Canada. He was ordained as a monk and practiced a daily schedule of meditation and service to the community; living by the vows of a novice monastic and learning from the Buddhist nun, teacher and community founder Pema Chödrön. Having completed this residency and returned to his role as Assistant Interfaith Adviser at the University of Westminster, he has been asked many times how it feels to be "back in the world". In this talk and discussion, he will share his experience of retreat / return, and other seemingly opposing notions like discipline / freedom and mundane / sacred, exploring how these categories now feel less distinct than he had previously thought them to be. He will also be sharing wildlife photos, answering questions (with an open invitation to the daring and critical) and dropping numerous quotes from Leonard Cohen, who spent seven years living in a Zen Buddhist monastery, along the way. For now, "back in the world", he can agree with Leonard's reflection on monastic life, that “it is a great luxury not to have to think about what you are doing next”.

Title: Roundtable: LGBTQ+ Rights and the Struggle for Democracy in Hong Kong | University of Westminster
Info: Hong Kong has been gripped by widespread protests and demands for greater democracy in recent months. While studies have begun to address the engagement of other marginalized groups such as women and ethnic minority in social movements and protest, the roles that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer plus (LGBTQ+) people play in non-LGBTQ+ specific politics have been given little academic attention. This invisibilization of LGBTQ+ people in wider social movement raises many questions. This roundtable will begin to explore the level of engagement of LGBTQ+ people in the movement for democracy in Hong Kong, pose questions about the intersections between LGBTQ+ rights and democracy and social justice, and ask whether these rights are articulated  in intersectional terms, or whether LGBTQ+ communities and rights are being overlooked or in the current protests in Hong Kong. We will also discuss comparisons with LGBTQ+ people and rights discourses in other struggles for democracy and social justice. All are welcome but registration is required. .

Title: Mediating, constructing and dismantling race(ism) | University of Westminster
Info: The 2020 International Conference: Mediating, Constructing, Dismantling Race(ism) is centred around the notion of 'Race' and its different cogent variations - 'racism', 'racialisation', 'racialised' - but brings race into conversation with global capitalism, transnational political processes, historical and contemporary social change and technological mediation. Institutional and structural racism are major realities that impede different areas of social life, both domestically and internationally. Over the past decade, mass protests in West Asia, North Africa, South America, and other parts of the world created an important transformative momentum, which in turn triggered debates about race, cultural difference and the role of anti-racism in grassroots politics against authoritarianism. The (not so) new issues activists are facing include migration, modern forms of slavery, backlash against indigenous assertion, the plight of south-Asian and African (domestic, construction) workers, the trafficking of female migrants across Europe, colourism and the mainstreaming of Far Right politics speaking against liberal multiculturalism in the defence of the imagined majority. The 2020 International Conference: Mediating, Constructing, Dismantling Race(ism) is centred around the notion of 'Race' and its different cogent variations - 'racism', 'racialisation', 'racialised' - but brings race into conversation with global capitalism, transnational political processes, historical and contemporary social change and technological mediation. This event is an initiative of the Communication and Media Research Institute's newly established Global Media Research Network (GMRN) and the Centre for the Study of Democracy at the University of Westminster. The full-day conference on the 17th of April 2020 provides a space to debate these questions; to understand the often-contentious relationship between theory and practice across disciplines; and to bring the work of activists and academics closer together. This event is part of the underlying aspiration to encourage critical collaboration between scholars and activists. We have programmed two internationally renowned keynotes to shed broader light through theoretical and practical areas of investigation. Our speakers are detailed below. This one-day conference on Friday 17th of April 2020, will consist of 2 academic keynote presentations, four parallel panel sessions and 3 academic-activist keynote presentations. *The fee for registration for all participants, including presenters, will be £45, with a concessionary rate of £15 for students and unwaged, to cover all conference documentation, refreshments and administration costs.

Title: The Body Politics of Data | University of Westminster
Info: The exhibition showcases artistic projects and experiments created throughout Alexandra Jonsson's postgraduate research at the , Westminster University, funded by the AHRC. It features projects exploring how maternity data is collected and used with The Body Recovery Unit (BRU) and maker and researcher Loes Bogers, public “Life Drawing the Attention Theft” events hosted by Deptford Cinema, and experiments in raising data as a collective concern with Autonomous Tech Fetish (ATF) and artist-researcher Cliff Hammett. The research explores how feminist artistic practice can inform new ways of thinking about the enormous amounts of data that we produce on a daily basis by shifting the focus from what data tells us to the conditions under which data is made. The exhibition invites you to reflect on how digital processes take hold of the body in different ways by showing the ‘material and visual thinking’ of artistic research. From drawing experiments, tea-drinking, body maps and care installations, the exhibition brings experimental engagements, collaborations and performative artworks with the social costs and bodily risks of data production to the fore.

Title: Remapping the cultural and linguistic landscape of the Chinese in Britain | University of Westminster
Info: The Chinese in Britain is one of the fastest growing communities. It is estimated the total number of Chinese has reached 500,000 by 2015. Approximately two-thirds of Chinese in Britain were born outside UK, with the majority coming from Hong Kong, China and Southeast Asia. The past two decades has witnessed a steady rise in the number of people from mainland China, including professionals, skilled workers, investors and young people who come to study in UK’s schools and universities. There is an urgent need to document and conceptualize this important demographic and cultural shift, not only for a better understanding of the new development of Chinese communities in the UK but also for the benefit of Britain whose future is increasingly built upon its understanding of and relations with the rest of the world including China. This conference is aimed at addressing this gap by bringing together researchers, Chinese language teachers, community leaders and policy makers to identify and examine the changing linguistic and cultural landscape of the Chinese in Britain. It is hosted by HOMELandS (Hub on Migration, Exiles, Languages and Spaces) in collaboration with the Contemporary China Centre of University of Westminster, and funded by Language Acts and World Making Small Grant Scheme, AHRC Open World Research Initiative (OWRI).

Title: Disrupt the Everyday project  two ghost gigs at Soho Poly basement | University of Westminster
Info: As part of the Centre for Law, Society and Popular Culture's project, we have run a series of ghost gigs over the past two years. Essentially the idea is that we tap into the University’s musical history, specifically by looking at bands and artists that have played the University, and celebrate their performances. Where we can source a recording of the performance, we arrange a playback of the recording on the anniversary of the day on which it took place, as far as possible in the space in which it took place, but do this at lunchtime to give you a potentially unusual way to enjoy your lunch and disrupt your day with something cultural. We have previously run events involving playbacks of gigs by Fleetwood Mac, and redskins. Two special events are coming up in this series. Whilst researching the Soho Poly Basement, we found a pre-history of the space when it was used as an Arts Workshop, and hosted gigs organised by the society. Excitingly, the former Chair of this group has given us copies of recordings he made direct from the ‘sound desk’. We are now intending to run two ghost gigs of polyfolk performances, on the 50th anniversary of when these took place, and in the space where these were originally performed.

Title: Anatomy of Structure: The Future of Art + Architecture | University of Westminster
Info: A major new show by global architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) in collaboration with Princeton University, TUDelft and Global Robots, takes over the 1300 m2 Ambika P3, presenting an action-packed live robotic construction and other innovations that transform the way we build now and in the future. Clues to help solve future challenges in design and construction from embodied carbon to structures inspired by nature can be found by examining SOM’s history of innovation in engineering, research, sustainability and the ground-breaking ideas that have shaped some of the world’s most significant structures and works of art. This quest is at the heart of this major new exhibition that will take a sweeping journey across the multidisciplinary design process at SOM. Through hand-drawn sketches, sculptures, research models, innovative digital fabrication methods, immersive videos, and a line–up of more than 30 structural building models of SOM’s most unique buildings, including: The exhibition seeks to establish a dialogue between past and present, ideas that lead to new architecture, and an unexpected approach to realising artworks. Organised according to five themes – Research + Future, Efficiency + Economy, Hierarchy + Order, Scale + Form, and Creation + Collaboration – visitors will tower over models of SOM’s tallest skyscrapers, and explore the intersection of art, architecture, structural design, with a dive into SOM’s recent collaborations with artists, including Janet Echelman, James Carpenter, Jaume Plensa, and Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle. At the heart of the show is a soaring vault built of glass bricks, assembled live onsite by robots through the course of the exhibition. A joint effort between SOM and Princeton University, USA, in consultation with the TU Delft Glass & Transparency Research Group in the Netherlands, the demonstration marries architecture and digital fabrication to explore the next frontier in building construction. Challenging conventional materials and construction methods, the exhibition explores a more sustainable future—with applicability today—driven by smarter materials, new efficient structures, and clever uses of automation. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) is an influential collective of architects, designers, engineers and planners, responsible for some of the world’s most technically and environmentally advanced buildings, and significant public spaces. From a strategic regional plan to a single piece of furniture, SOM's designs anticipate change in the way we live, work and communicate, and have brought lasting value to communities around the world. The firm's approach is highly collaborative, and its interdisciplinary team is engaged on a wide range of international projects, with creative studios based across the globe.

This documentary follows Kris and his husband as they prepare with the participants of their Wheely Fitness Class to go to the Superhero Paratri. We all need it – but what is the power of support? Kris Saunders Stowe was at rock bottom until he found a support network that, for the first time, allowed him to find empowerment in his disability. Kris has osteoarthritis, a condition which breaks down the cartilage in his joints. Now it's his mission to inspire others to find the same, regardless of their sexuality or ability, so they too can enjoy the liberation of accepting their disability. Kris does this by taking his all access, disability friendly fitness class on their toughest journey yet. The superhero series is a multi-sport para-triathlon that will show you, and the world, the strength, and ability of the community Kris has built around him. – University of Westminster Alumni Jamie Wareham is the Head of Digital Production at Attitude Magazine and host of National Student Pride's podcast #QueerAF.

Url: https://www.westminster.ac.uk/events/chinese-independent-film-festivals-self-legitimation-and-consecrations
Title: Chinese Independent Film Festivals: Self-Legitimation and Consecrations | University of Westminster
Info: This talk focuses on three major Chinese independent film festivals, the China Independent Film Festival (CIFF), the Yunnan Multi-Culture Visual Festival (Yunfest) and the Beijing Independent Film Festival (BIFF), which not only showcase and promote Chinese independent films, but also facilitate exchanges between independent filmmakers. These festivals generated much social and academic discourse on Chinese independent films from early 2000s to mid-2010s and used to be the main platforms for public audiences to watch independent films which do not have legal domestic distribution status. Following the dissemination of independent films, issues such as the violation of conventional documentary ethics, low quality DV image, ambiguous authorship, undefined film license have stirred controversies. Additionally, the legitimacy of independent film festivals has also been questioned due to successive forced shut-downs and interruptions by local authorities. Drawing from ethnography from extensive fieldwork, this talk scrutinises a set of practices of independent film festivals including film distributing, awarding, reviewing, publishing and archiving. It will highlight the symbolic implications for the practices of independent films and these film festivals per se. Drawing on Bourdieu’s concept of cultural production, Dr Lydia Wu will demonstrate how independent film festivals establish a set of relationships within a wider cultural field to engage in the production of social value of independent films by adopting certain practices consistent with cultural beliefs and norms of the prevailing cultural production system. Such practices create artistic valorisation for the consecration of independent films, which in turn reinforces their legitimacy. The research also reveals an inherent paradox: cultural and social accounts of independent film festivals form what counts as independent films, whereas the independent films are averse to any accounts that define and shape them for sustaining and protecting independence.

Title: The Power of Representation and Representation of Power: Nation, Ethnicity and Truth in Modern China | University of Westminster
Info: This is part of the 2020 which is co-organised with the , University of Westminster. Since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has maintained strict control over the production of information across the media and educational materials across the country. What kinds of ‘truth’ has this produced, and how have these ‘truths’ allowed the CCP to retain its legitimacy as China’s sole ruling organisation? Our talk explores truth and representation in Chinese state propaganda. Focusing on how ethnic minorities have been represented in visual propaganda materials from the Mao era to the present, we examine how certain ‘truths’ about ethnicity in China have been produced and the role these ‘truths’ have played in consolidating notions of a unified Chinese nation. We begin with a brief history of ethnic relations in China, describing how the question of ethnicity has long been a point of particular sensitivity and insecurity for the Chinese state. We then discuss some examples of visual representations of ethnicity in China, including a selection of Mao-era Chinese propaganda posters from the University of Westminster’s Archive’s China Visual Arts Project’s collection. We hope that this event will promote critical reflection on the role of language and imagery in the production of ideas about ethnicity and nation in modern China, and about ‘truth’ more broadly. The event will be followed by a drinks reception. University of Westminster, Fyvie Hall, 309 Regent Street, London W1B 2HW

Title: The Truth about Happiness | University of Westminster
Info: This is part of the 2020 which is co-organised with the , University of Westminster. This talk will question the seemingly universally accepted notion that we should all strive to be as happy as possible, that negative feelings are to be banished, and that individuals need to work on a positive outlook. We will start with some background information on the rise of happiness studies and world happiness reports. This will set the scene to question how reliable such statistics actually are and why they have become so popular. We will then look at different views on happiness from different cultures and civilisations across the world - not all of which idealise happiness. The talk, which will be delivered jointly with students on Professor Wielander’s module “Concepts of Happiness Across Cultures”, will stimulate the audience to think critically about the “happiness imperative”, but jointly we will also try to work out common denominators on happiness across cultures.

Title: #Homohindunationalism: Politics of Sexuality in the times of Majoritarianism in India | University of Westminster
Info: This event is an exploration of the larger theme of growing homonationalism globally – a term originally coined by Jasbir Puar to explain the association between nationalists and members from the LGBTQ community.

Title: Maoism  A Global History: Professor Julia Lovell and Professor Harriet Evans in Conversation | University of Westminster
Info: In this book event, Professor Julia Lovell will be talking about her new book on Maoism as a global phenomenon with Professor Harriet Evans as discussant. For decades, the West has dismissed Maoism as an outdated historical and political phenomenon. Since the 1980s, China seems to have abandoned the utopian turmoil of Mao’s revolution in favour of authoritarian capitalism. But Mao and his ideas remain central to the People’s Republic and the legitimacy of its Communist government. With disagreements and conflicts between China and the West on the rise, the need to understand the political legacy of Mao is urgent and growing. The power and appeal of Maoism have extended far beyond China. Maoism was a crucial motor of the Cold War: it shaped the course of the Vietnam War (and the international youth rebellions that conflict triggered) and brought to power the murderous Khmer Rouge in Cambodia; it aided, and sometimes handed victory to, anti-colonial resistance movements in Africa; it inspired terrorism in Germany and Italy, and wars and insurgencies in Peru, India and Nepal, some of which are still with us today – more than forty years after the death of Mao. In this new publication on new history, Julia Lovell re-evaluates Maoism as both a Chinese and an international force, linking its evolution in China with its global legacy. It is a story that takes us from the tea plantations of north India to the sierras of the Andes, from Paris’s fifth arrondissement to the fields of Tanzania, from the rice paddies of Cambodia to the terraces of Brixton. Starting with the birth of Mao’s revolution in northwest China in the 1930s and concluding with its violent afterlives in South Asia and resurgence in the People’s Republic today, this is a landmark history of global Maoism. Cayley 152-153, University of Westminster, 309 Regent Street, London W1B 2HW Julia Lovell is Professor of Modern China at Birkbeck College, University of London. Her two most recent books are The Great Wall and The Opium War (which won the 2012 Jan Michalski Prize). Her many translations of modern Chinese fiction into English include Lu Xun's The Real Story of Ah Q, and other Tales of China (2009). She is currently completing a new translation of Journey to the West by Wu Cheng'en. She writes about China for several newspapers, including the Guardian, Financial Times, New York Times and Wall Street Journal. She has also received many accolades, including winning the 2019 Cundill History Prize and nominations for the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction 2019, the Nayef Al-Rodhan Prize For Global Understanding and the Deutscher Prize. Professor Harriet Evans is Professor Emerita of Chinese Cultural Studies (University of Westminster) and Visiting Professor of Anthropology (LSE). She has written extensively on the politics of gender and sexuality in China, and on political posters and visual culture of the Mao era. Her main publications are Women and Sexuality in China: Dominant Discourses of Female Sexuality and Gender since 1949 (1997), Picturing Power in the People’s Republic of China: Posters of the Cultural Revolution (co-edited with Stephanie Hemelryk Donald, 1999), and The Subject of Gender: Daughters and Mothers in Urban China (2008). Her Beijing from Below: Stories of Marginal Lives in the Capital’s Center (Duke University Press) will be published in May 2020. She is currently working on a volume to mark the completion of a three-year research project, funded by the Leverhulme Trust, under the title Grassroots Values: Localities and Cultural Heritage in China.

Title: 8th International Workshop on Ontologies and Conceptual Modelling (OntoCom) | University of Westminster
Info: The International Workshop on Ontologies and Conceptual Modelling (OntoCom) is an academic workshop that concerns the practical and formal application of ontologies to conceptual modelling. While models pervade the information systems lifecycle from requirements to implementation, there appears to be a lack of theoretical foundation in the way that models are developed. As a result it is quite common for practitioners, even working together, to produce different representations of the same real world domain or system. Conversely, a preferred approach would be one in which IS practitioners have the necessary conceptual tools to enable them to accurately represent the things that exist in the real world. Foundational or upper ontologies have the potential to resolve the difficult problems that derive from a lack of a consistent and sound ontological theory. The benefits that can derive from the application of a foundational ontology include improved mapping to the real world domain, increased level of communication and understanding among stakeholders, model reuse, semantic integration and interoperability and increased overall efficiency and effectiveness of information systems development and evolution. The theme of OntoCom will continue to be Foundational Ontologies and their Meta-ontological Choices. The workshop will be practically oriented and discussions will be centred on models produced for different kinds of case studies. More specifically, we intend to provide several case studies that each focus on a concrete modelling problem. Next, during our workshop, we would discuss and clarify each of these case studies using several different foundational ontologies. The purpose of this discussion is to discover and evaluate how the different ontologies would distinguish themselves in representing each of these case studies and their respective problems. Consequently, this would lead to highly interesting discussions between experts of different kinds of ontologies. As such, this workshop is aimed at providing a platform to stimulate high expert discussions concerning the application of different kinds of foundational ontologies to a set of distinct modelling problems. The structure of the workshop would thus be as followed: we would accept contributions that concern the above-mentioned topics (or even on topics related to the main workshop theme) and demonstrate these contributions during SLAM sessions, or short power point presentations that explain the main idea of the paper. Contributions in the form of research, research-in-progress papers and practitioner reports are welcome. Next, our sessions would be focused on presenting several case studies and possible interpretations of these case studies by various foundational ontologies. Together with the audience, we would then discuss the advantages, disadvantages, main distinctions and possible changes in each of these representations by the foundational ontologies.

Info: Polytechnic of Central London For this ghost gig we encourage people to explore whilst the music plays. You will be the first people to hear the recording, almost 50 years to the day since it originally took place. Ralph McTell is a well-known and celebrated folk artist. He is perhaps best known for his classic ‘Streets of London’, reportedly covered over 200 times, and his ode to emigration ‘From Clare to Here’. The first of these appears on this recording. He performed at the Poly on 11 April 1970. We play it three days before it actually took place due to the anniversary falling on a weekend. It is a superb recording of an important artist. The event on 11 April was in fact not only the last one of that academic year, but the very last one in our Little Titchfield Street building.

Title: Racism and Orientalism: An Online Roundtable on Racialised Discourse on COVID-19 | University of Westminster
Info: Across the globe, racism against East Asians, particularly people of Chinese ethnicity, whether in person or on the Internet, has been widely reported since the outbreak of COVID-19. The United States President Donald Trump has referred to the virus as “the Chinese virus”, fuelling verbal and physical abuse and xenophobia towards Asian Americans. In the United Kingdom, there have been incidents of mask-wearing Chinese and Asian students becoming targets for racist attacks. This phenomenon is not only a problematic combination of racist hatred and maskaphobia, but also constitutes a dilemma for Asians who are forced to choose between exposing themselves to the threat of Coronavirus and fear of racist abuse. On the other hand, the association of the virus with a particular ethnicity or Asians who exhibit Chinese physical characteristics has also contributed to a conflation of Asians, Chinese people, China and the Chinese government. Under the mask of political critique against the authoritarian-backward Other and concerns over the health and safety of non-Asian populations, central to the racialised and political discourse on the COVID-19 crisis is a dangerous Orientalism that exposes the limits of ethnic and cultural diversity, and frustrates efforts of states in ensuring the overall well-being of its residents in an increasingly globalised and connected world. In response to these issues, the Contemporary China Centre has invited four panellists for a roundtable discussion to share their insights and experiences. DrShzr Ee Tan is a Senior Lecturer and ethnomusicologist (with a specialism in Sinophone and Southeast Asian worlds) at Royal Holloway, University of London. She is interested in impact-based issues of music and decolonisation, aspirational cosmopolitanism, and anti-racist activism in music scenes around the world (including HE), with a view towards understanding marginality through the lenses of intersectionality. Her recent research project initiated with Mai Kawabata, 'Cultural Imperialism and the 'New Yellow Peril' in Western Art Music, has gained considerable traction among East Asian music communities around the world and turned her towards more activist-informed scholarship and teaching. Dr Diana Yeh is Senior Lecturer in Sociology, Culture and the Creative Industries, City, University of London. She works on race and racisms, migration, cultural politics and activism. She is author of The Happy Hsiungs: Performing China and the Struggle for Modernity (2014) and co-editor of Contesting British Chinese Culture (2018). She is currently Principal Investigator of the British Academy/Leverhulme funded project ‘Becoming East and Southeast Asian: Race, Ethnicity and Youth Politics of Belonging’. She is also researching racial inequalities in the creative and cultural industries, via the project BEAST: British East Asians on Screen and in Television, which has led to a series of collaborative short films by Rosa Fong. Flair Donglai Shi (施東來) is a final year Ph.D. student at the University of Oxford and works at Warwick University as Associate Tutor in Translation and Cultures (2018-2020).His doctoral project investigates the racist concept of “the Yellow Peril” as a traveling discourse in contexts as diverse as early 20th century England, Apartheid South Africa, post-Mao China and post-handover Hong Kong. His articles on postcolonial feminism, Chinese literature, and world literature have been published in Comparative Critical Studies, Women: A Cultural Review, Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews, and Comparative Literature & World Literature, etc. His other research interests include Alice in Wonderland and China, Chinese British cultural history, and China-Africa relations in the cultural domain. Sam Phan (潘家森) is a British-Asian freelance journalist and MA Translation and Interpreting Studies student currently studying at the University of Manchester. Born in Vietnam with both Chinese and Vietnamese heritage, Phan is interested in the themes of belonging, race and identity and is also a strong advocate for social justice and equality. These themes run throughout his work where he aims to amplify Asian voices as well as to challenge injustice against all marginalized people. He has most notably written and produced media content for The Guardian, and has also appeared on the BBC, LBC, and Sky News.

Title: Relaunch of the Centre for Law, Gender, Race and Sexuality | University of Westminster
Info: Westminster Law School held a re-launch of the Centre for Law, Gender and Sexuality (Centre LGS) as the Centre for Law, Gender, Race and Sexuality. Our law school has long been the site for research and teaching of feminism, gender and sexuality. Equally, racial identity has been a fundamental consideration and research topic for our staff and students alike, particularly because Westminster University is one of the most diverse in the United Kingdom where the actuality of working in a community where people come from different backgrounds is not an abstract idea but a lived reality. The evolving political landscape has meant that issues of racialised inequalities have been thrust to the fore. Influenced by movements to broaden access and diversity and calls to decolonise the curriculum we decided to specifically include race within the remit of the Centre. To discuss this development and to celebrate the re-launch of our centre we invited: Dr Suhraiya Jivraj, Senior Lecturer in Law , Deputy Director of Education (Decolonise the Curriculum),  Co-Director Centre for Sexuality, Race and Gender Justice, University of Kent,  Dr Alex Dymock, Lecturer in Law,  Goldsmith University and discussant Professor Dibyesh Anand, Head of Politics and International Relations. There was a lively discussion and a celebration of the renaming of the centre.

Info: COVID-19 has changed our lives in innumerable and immeasurable ways. While perhaps not the most significant constraint, challenges to how we can, do, and perhaps should conduct research – about the virus and the pandemic, and/or while living in lockdown – has shaped many of our professional lives. As we look to a future with ongoing constraints, there are questions that we, as a university and as a research community, should be asking: What are the practical, methodological and ethical dimensions to conducting research in a pandemic, when some traditional methods (e.g. ethnographic fieldwork, face to face focus groups, collecting human tissues) are not practicable or safe? How can and should we surmount them? What type of research can and should we be doing in the current context, and what innovations are we using to conduct research ethically, soundly, and to a high standard? What advice and support can we give each other as we strive to conduct responsible and robust research in the COVID-19 context? How can these constraints and innovations inform our research going forward? and are co-organising a where we can present our work and our thinking about these and related issues. The conference is open to any member of the University of Westminster, from all disciplines and at all career stages (including postgraduate students).

Title: Challenging Deep Pockets  Part of London Festival of Architecture Digital | University of Westminster
Info: The University of Westminster represented by Iman Keaik, is excited to host an online webinar about the four conflicting powers in London. Who owns London? Are people becoming intangible and invisible in the city of conflicting power? How can we imagine a city of consumption ripped from its money power and transformed into a city of production? This project ‘Challenging Deep Pockets’ explores London as a conflicted city of powers, where people’s right to the city is a forgotten phenomenon, and the citizens step through the controlled ground. The project is unique because the research is led by design and it allows spontaneous practices to come in and shape the project. This new approach to transform the city into a cashless city revolving around its production is also analysed after the unprecedented circumstances of COVID-19. This pandemic shed light on the number of non-essential shops closed on the High street of Oxford Street in an emergency lockdown. The imagined scenario is that the pandemic lasts few years while the city would deteriorate, and the bird’s nests would take over the streets. These empty unused shops will, therefore, accommodate new functions that serve the in-house production of London. The session will include the following: Join us for an open conversation that will lead to the sharing of fresh ideas and views about conflicting powers in London. The webinar will be held via Zoom.

Next to each word on your list, there is another set of words that you are not allowed to say. For example, if you have the word “whisper” you have to describe the word without saying “quiet, secret, talk, or softly”. You would also not allowed to say “whispering or whispered” as it contains the word “whisper”. Points are scored by each word that is correctly guessed by us in 1 minute. You can pass on words that are tricky and if you say one of the banned words, you must move on to the next word.

Title: The Automated Citizen? Civic Participation in a Datafied Society - Arne Hintz | University of Westminster
Info: will be presenting a paper ‘The Automated Citizen? Civic Participation in a Datafied Society’. Citizens are increasingly assessed, profiled, categorized and scored according to data assemblages, their future behaviour is predicted through data processing, and services are allocated accordingly. This happens largely without our understanding and avenues to intervene, and it therefore raises significant questions about democratic processes, active citizenship and public participation. This presentation will discuss the role of the 'automated citizen' in this context. Further, it will explore emerging mechanisms for citizens to intervene in the development and implementation of data systems, from oversight bodies to citizen assemblies, and thereby highlight new forms of civic participation in an increasingly datafied society.

Title: Out of Time: The Queer Politics of Postcoloniality - Rahul Rao | University of Westminster
Info: will be introducing his new book . Between 2009 and 2014, an anti-homosexuality law circulating in the Ugandan parliament came to be the focus of a global conversation about queer rights. The law attracted attention for the draconian nature of its provisions and for the involvement of US evangelical Christian activists who were said to have lobbied for its passage. Focusing on the Ugandan case, this book seeks to understand the encounters and entanglements across geopolitical divides that produce and contest contemporary queerphobias. It investigates the impact and memory of the colonial encounter on the politics of sexuality, the politics of religiosity of different Christian denominations, and the political economy of contemporary homophobic moral panics. In addition, Out of Time places the Ugandan experience in conversation with contemporaneous developments in India and Britain – three locations that are yoked together by the experience of British imperialism and its afterlives. Intervening in a queer theoretical literature on temporality, Rahul Rao argues that time and space matter differently in the queer politics of postcolonial countries. By employing an intersectional analysis and drawing on a range of sources, Rao offers an original interpretation of why queerness mutates to become a metonym for categories such as nationality, religiosity, race, class, and caste. The book argues that these mutations reveal the deep grammars forged in the violence that founds and reproduces the social institutions in which queer difference struggles to make space for itself.

Title: Towards a theoretical synergy: interrogating critical race theory and decolonial thought - Ali Meghji | University of Westminster
Info: will be presenting a paper ‘Towards a theoretical synergy: interrogating critical race theory and decolonial thought’ There is a burgeoning interest in the differences between the sociology of race and decolonial thought. This talk develops such discussions by focusing on decolonial thought and a seemingly incongruous paradigm the sociology of race – critical race theory (CRT). While decolonial thought stresses the continuity of colonial power relations, is committed to transnational and temporally connected analysis, and tends to use historical methods, CRT is based around the premise that contemporary racism must be analysed outside of colonial legacies, tends to analyse nation states outside of their global interlinkages, and methodologically commits to a ‘presentism’ by focusing on the contemporary day. Nevertheless, despite these differences, in this talk Dr Meghji argues that CRT and decolonial thought can synergize to provide prescient analysis of contemporary crises. To display the efficacy of this synergy, he focuses on two case studies: right-wing populism, and the coronavirus pandemic. In each of these cases, we see that neither CRT nor decolonial thought can analyse them sufficiently on their own, but that together they can address each other’s blindspots. He therefore aims to synergize decolonial thought and CRT to open new avenues in the social sciences for globally oriented analysis that pays attention to national particularities.

Title: Decolonising the Anthropocene: The Politics of Ecology and Indigeneity - Elisa Randazzo | University of Westminster
Info: will be presenting a paper ‘Decolonising the Anthropocene: The Politics of Ecology and Indigeneity’. This paper argues that a theoretical encounter between Western ecological scholarship and Indigenous scholarship sheds light on the problematically depoliticising effects of the holistic Anthropocene meta-narrative which prevail in critical approaches to Anthropocene thought in social sciences. The paper suggests that arguments developed in a strand of Anthropocene literature identified as ‘continuous’, parallel Indigenous knowledges and cosmologies in terms of a relational understanding of Being, a conception of agency which is open to non-humans and networks of different actors and an ecological shaping power which cannot be fully controlled by human communities and thus calls for a governance which is responsive, local and adaptive. Drawing on Critical Indigenous Studies, the paper then formulates a critique of how ‘continuous’ relational perspectives to the Anthropocene enfold alternative ontologies and politics within an overarching Anthropocene ontology which is not only problematically universalising, but also replaces the genuine engagement with differences and resistance.

Title: Yellow star, red star: Holocaust remembrance after communism  Jelena Subotic | University of Westminster
Info: (Georgia State University) will be presenting a paper based on her book . . Yellow Star, Red Star asks why Holocaust memory continues to be so deeply troubled – ignored, appropriated, and obfuscated –throughout Eastern Europe, even though it was in those lands that most of the extermination campaign occurred. As part of accession to the European Union, East European states were required to adopt, participate in, and contribute to the established Western narrative of the Holocaust. This requirement created anxiety and resentment in post-communist states: Holocaust memory replaced communist terror as the dominant narrative in Eastern Europe, focusing instead on predominantly Jewish suffering in World War II. Influencing the European Union's own memory politics and legislation in the process, post-communist states have attempted to reconcile these two memories by pursuing new strategies of Holocaust remembrance. The memory, symbols, and imagery of the Holocaust have been appropriated to represent crimes of communism. Yellow Star, Red Star presents in-depth accounts of Holocaust remembrance practices in Serbia, Croatia, and Lithuania, and extends the discussion to other East European states. She concludes that Holocaust memory in Eastern Europe has never been about the Holocaust or about the desire to remember the past, whether during communism or in its aftermath. Rather, it has been about managing national identities in a precarious and uncertain world. The talk will be based on Jelena’s book Yellow Star, Red Star which has won a number of awards: including Robert Jervis and Paul Schroeder Best Book Award (American Political Science Association), Best Book Award in European Politics and Society (European Politics and Society Section, American Political Science Association) and Joseph Rothschild Prize in Nationalism and Ethnic Studies. The seminar will take place online. . The Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD) is based in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Westminster.

Title: Coloniality and Dehumanisation in Contemporary Times: A Talk Series | University of Westminster
Info: Join a panel discussion with Uyghur activists and academics to understand the ongoing situation in Xinijiang and impacts on Uyghur community. The Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD), within the School of Social Sciences, has researched themes focusing on post-colonial politics, development and emerging powers. There is an explicit focus on engagement with communities and impacting upon public debates around contentious themes. Through this new talk series that highlights the experiences of people facing oppression, occupation, and rights abuses, we aim to bring together academics, activists and students to engage on pressing issues of coloniality in the postcolonial world. Our first talk in the series looks at the region that is homeland of Uyghurs, referred to as Xinjiang in China, and the condition of inhabitants there. While international media has begun to highlight various examples of collective punishment of Uyghur Muslims by the State, including what many see as concentration camps, Beijing continues to deny it as ‘foreign propaganda’. Who are the Uyghurs? How does China treat Uyghurs living under its control in Xinjiang Autonomous Region? Why should the world, including those of us in the UK, care about what is happening to Uyghurs? Is it fair to understand the dehumanising experiences of Uyghurs as one of colonised people? Our panel members include Uyghur activists and experts on China and Uyghurs who will be providing their insights, followed by a question & answer round with the audience. The panel will be chaired by Professor Dibyesh Anand.

Title: Sinophone creative responses to COVID-19, racism, and xenophobia | University of Westminster
Info: For Chinese-speaking communities in the UK and elsewhere, COVID-19 has witnessed a steep rise in racism and xenophobia. Alongside efforts to combat COVID-19 related racism and support those who have experienced discrimination, Chinese-speaking communities have been producing and circulating Chinese-language materials about the virus through various creative means and media, in an attempt to foster new forms of understanding about their respective communities to broader audiences. Building on the overwhelming public response to our previous roundtable on racialised discourses and COVID-19, this workshop is part of a series of events exploring the ways in which different Chinese communities have been responding to COVID-19 and the ensuing wave of racism and xenophobia. Through collaboration with academics, activists, and local communities, we aim to map out the creative responses emanating from a diverse range of Chinese cultures and build new alliances and networks to fuel resistance, action, and change. What strategies, resources and ideas can be shared for intervening in prevailing COVID-19-fuelled racisms to build towards a more equitable future? In this event, we have invited Dr Diana Yeh, Flair Donglai Shi, Sam Phan and Dr Shzr Ee Tan back from the March roundtable to share their reflections on how the fear and ignorance around COVID-19 have continued to fan pre-existing racisms and expose social faultlines, and the kinds of responses that have sought to resist and challenge such practices. This second half is a workshop led by Dr Denise Kwan in which participants move into breakout groups to explore the following thematics: This is an online event.

Sartfell Retreat is part of a growing body of commissions through which the practice explores the relationship between landscape and self-sustaining architecture. Foster Lomas’ response to the site relates to their research and experience of drystone construction whilst working in the Abruzzo region of Italy. Building on this vernacular technology, they have reinterpreted the local Manx stone structures to create an original building in its unique setting.

Title: Technical Studies Lecture Series: Jingxian YE - The Zaojing  A unique timber typology | University of Westminster
Info: The zaojing (Chinese: 藻井; pinyin: zǎojǐng) is an ancient Chinese construction system for dome-shaped ceilings that combines small reciprocally interlocking timber components. Zaojing is found in temples, pagodas, palaces, colleges, and theatres – typically directly above a religious statue, throne, podium, or opera stage. These structures are placed above live performance spaces to enhance sound diffusion while creating a compelling visual setting. In spite of their uniqueness and historical interest, very little literature about the zaojing is known to exist, and what does, is not comprehensive. The talk will showcase recent field investigations and first-hand account in rural China, shedding new light on these remarkable structures. Jingxian YE studied political science and architecture at Fudan University and Tongji University in China. After her bachelor's study, she continued her master's in architecture at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich (ETHZ), and subsequently travelled to Germany to conduct archival research on the work of architect Heinz Bienefeld. Jingxian is currently a PhD candidate in the Structural Xploration Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and her work is focused on sustainable construction. Jingxian has also lectured at the Architecture Department Hong Kong University Shanghai Study Center, and in 2018, Jingxian YE became a member of the ICOMOS International Wood Committee (IIWC). The Technical Studies Open lecture program (part of University of Westminster’s School of Architecture and Cities) is an open lecture series, where architects, engineers, writers, social theorists and artists are invited to take part in a discussion about the social use and function of technology in the context of design.

Title: Technical Studies Lecture Series: Sophie Hicks  Recent Projects | University of Westminster
Info: Sophie Hicks established Sophie Hicks Architects in 1990 whilst still a student at the Architectural Association and she became a chartered architect in 1994. Prior to her career as an architect she worked in fashion: as a stylist for Vogue Magazine and for the designer, Azzedine Alaia. She leads a practice with a focus on both fashion retail and private residential design. Her retail projects include Westbourne House with Paul Smith, his "shop in a house", and the development of a store concept for Chloé, with signature plywood walls, which has been used in over one hundred stores worldwide. Sophie has also worked closely with Yohji Yamamoto to design his flagship store in Paris, and she created a new-build flagship store for Acne Studios in Seoul. In parallel with her retail designs, Sophie Hicks acquired three sites in London, all in conservation areas, with the intention of building a contemporary house on each. The first, a small house in Regent Square, was completed in 2014. The second, a street-facing house in Earl’s Court Square, was completed in 2018. The third, a larger house in Holland Park, has obtained planning permission. New-build, contemporary houses are relatively rare in central London, because of the strong culture in the UK of preservation of the historic environment. Sophie has designed these new houses to "respect the past, and respond to it, while at the same time expressing the spirit of our own times." Sophie Hicks is a member of the Panel for Creative and Design at the Institute for Apprenticeships (IFA). The aim of the IFA is to improve the work opportunities and job satisfaction of young people, avoid student debt, and address the skills shortage in the UK.

This series supports outstanding scholarship in the history of architecture and allied fields, building on the work of Professor Robin Evans (1944-1993). It encourages scholars working on the relationship between the spatial and social domains in architectural drawing, construction and beyond. Evans’ work interrogated the spaces that existed between drawing and building, geometry and architecture, teasing out the points of translation often overlooked. From his early work on prison design and domestic spaces, through to his later work on architectural geometry, Evans sought to articulate the multiple points at which the human imagination could influence architectural form. His first book, The Fabrication of Virtue, analysed the way that spatial layouts provided opportunities for social reform via their interference with morality, privacy and class. In The Projective Cast: Architecture and its Three Geometries, Evans traced the origins of the humanist tradition to understand how human form influenced architectural drawing and construction, focusing on aesthetic dimensions in the production of architectural space. This series will provide opportunities for the creation and/or dissemination of work by scholars working on similar questions of space, temporality, and architecture. In particular, it supports work that breaks the boundaries of traditional disciplines to think though these complex networks involved in the space between human imagination and architectural production.

Title: Westminster Open Talks - Digital Transformation During the Pandemic and Beyond | University of Westminster
Info: Dr Panos Hahamis reflects on the future trajectory of digitisation of services in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we live, work and socialise, putting digital technologies at the forefront by accelerating many long-standing trends. From working from home, to how we meet with friends and family virtually, to the digital transformation of services provided by governments, including the health sector, we have all responded (and adapted) in unexpected and innovative ways. Video conferencing platforms provided by various companies for example, saw a meteoric rise in their use, with Zoom alone rocketing both in users and sales. All of these software companies are already looking for continued growth beyond the pandemic as workplaces take on a new definition. The same is happening with governments which had to react quickly to new requirements (and restrictions) by working on, and implementing new digital modules on their government portals. The talk will be followed by a short Q&A session.

Title: Language, law and order: disciplining English in UK schools  Ian Cushing | University of Westminster
Info: Part of the English Language and Linguistics Research Seminar Series , Brunel University London, will be presenting a paper on ‘Language, law and order: disciplining English in UK schools’. This talk presents an analysis of various language policy mechanisms currently circulating in secondary schools in England, with a particular focus on those that intermingle ‘language’, ‘standardised English’, ‘behaviour’ and ‘discipline’. Although the connections between language, ideology and behaviour are well-established within critical educational linguistics, this has not been explored in relation to current education policy in England, which is characterised by an overt focus on standardised English and behaviour ‘management’. In a grounded approach, I explore how the disciplining of language correlates with the disciplining of the body, using ethnographic-orientated fieldwork undertaken in a London secondary school and drawing on a broad range of policy mechanisms such as curricula, textbooks, classroom artefacts, pedagogies and the behaviour ‘management’ educational resource industry. I show how the current linguistic conservatism found within government policy gets reproduced in school-level policies, pedagogies and classroom interactions, and highlight these relations within a network of policy actors and keywords associated with so-called ‘zero-tolerance’ and ‘no-excuses’ schools. I show how teachers are positioned as language policy managers who work within a system of surveillance, compliance, coercion and control, which leads to the enactment of ‘outlawed literacies’. As such, this talk offers an expanded view of language ideologies in schools, whereby connections between language and discipline are explicitly illustrated and critiqued. All welcome!

Title: A Zine of Collective Care: Covid-19 & Racism  Workshop 1 | University of Westminster
Info: 'A Zine of Collective Care: Covid-19 & Racism' is a digital zine workshop centred on sharing as nourishment and creativity as healing. In a time when racism is increasing against Chinese and South East Asian bodies, this hostility surrounds the mind and spirit of those bodies during this pandemic. This digital Zoom workshop offers a restorative space of collective sharing through art and zine making. The process of zine making creates a place to hear each other, amplify voices and build from a place of collective care. As Audre Lorde says, "Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare." This workshop is a part of a wider series of workshops exploring themes of care through food and nourishment, intergenerational intimacy, and the body itself. Your creative response to these ideas will form a shareable digital zine. During a time where bodies of Chinese and East Asian heritage are experiencing racial hostility, what does it mean to feel and be in our bodies? Through sensory activities, we will consider the importance of care and nourishment and how deep care can revive power necessary for ourselves, our communities and to build solidarity. To explore care and nourishment, this workshop associates care as embodied through food, daily routines/rituals such as gardening and walking, to consider how methods of care can be shared to hold space for one another. As a two-part workshop, these provocations will be explored through shared sensory meditation and collage making. Sensory meditation on oranges, power, nourishment and bodies. Create an object-centred instruction to share power. By signing up to this event, you are reserving a place for Workshop 1 only, which is run over 2 dates (15 and 22 November). Please ensure that you are able to attend both dates before registering. Spaces are limited to 15 per session. Register for the event via Please note, this workshop is aimed at bringing together people of Chinese and South East Asian heritages. No prior expertise is necessary to join the session but as a collaborative workshop, participants will be invited to participate in a group exercise and discussion.

Title: #Homohindunationalism: Panel on the politics of sexuality amidst growing global authoritarianism | University of Westminster
Info: The Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD), within the School of Social Sciences, has research themes that include gender and sexuality as well as Post-Colonial Politics, Development and Emerging Powers. There is an explicit focus on engagement with communities and impacting upon public debates around these contentious subjects. India is one such region. This event is an exploration of the larger theme of homonationalism globally – a term originally coined by Jasbir Puar to explain the association between nationalists and members from the LGBTQ community. In some places, right-wing nationalisms that would in the past dehumanise LGBTQ persons have sought to reframe themselves and appropriate and discipline LGBTQ movements. Islamophobia is deployed by many instances of these homonationalisms. This panel discussion will focus on the growing trend of #homohindunationalism in India, where in there has been an attempt to label and pass rightwing Hindu government policies as pro-lgbtq community even though the track record of Hindu nationalism is resolutely queerphobic. Is this a welcome change on the part of the right wing? Or, is it a cynical move to present a progressive and liberal face in the West? Or is it a ploy to prevent solidarities between LGBTQ and religious minority communities in India? For instance, why would sections of queer movement rally in favour of Indian government’s unilateral annexation of Kashmir while others oppose it? Is the representation of right-wing Hindu nationalist action as ‘liberating the LGBTQ community of Jammu & Kashmir’ partly fair? How is the queer community in India responding to recent large scale protests against discriminatory citizenship laws? Should LGBTQ movement, still nascent in India where homosexuality was decriminalised only recently, keep out of solidarity politics and focus on Pride as celebration or should it become immersed? What is the controversy over the Transgender Persons Act 2019 all about? How are activist queer spaces organized and what are the hierarchies of oppression that exist within these? What challenges exist in South Asian diasporas in general and Indian diaspora in particular when it comes to negotiating LGBTQ rights/identities and cultural identities? This multi-disciplinary panel will bring together queer scholars who research the above themes in conversation.

Title: Observation in the poems of Siegfried Sassoon: a cognitive grammar approach - Marcello Giovanelli | University of Westminster
Info: Part of the English Language and Linguistics Research Seminar Series , Aston University, will be presenting a paper on ' Observation in the poems of Siegfried Sassoon: a cognitive grammar approach'. Cognitive Grammar (Langacker 2008) has emerged in recent years to become an established analytical method in cognitive stylistics. One of its key affordances is that it provides a framework for analysing the meaningfulness of different types of grammatical representations yet a recent evaluation of work using the model (West 2017) has argued that researchers have tended to ignore the important matter of authorial creativity in their analyses of texts. This paper aims to redress the balance by using Cognitive Grammar to examine the relationship between ‘construal phenomena’ (Langacker 2008: 55), the unique situations that give rise to writing, and the interpretations of readers engaging with texts. The paper builds both on the work of Kövecses (2015), who has argued that one particular construal phenomenon, metaphor, can be understood as emerging from specific situational contexts, and on the increasingly common practice in contemporary stylistics of explaining textual phenomena through reference to the responses of real readers. In this paper, I examine a number of poems written by the English First World War poet Siegfried Sassoon. I demonstrate how responses provided by readers (both literary-critical and in a small corpus obtained from the online review site Goodreads) that argue that Sassoon is foremost a visual poet of intense observation can be explained, using Cognitive Grammar, through close attention to the ways in which Sassoon construes events and the characters. I also argue that these construals may be contextualized and understood as motivated by the particular physical, social and cultural environments in which Sassoon was writing.

Title: Factors influencing family language policy  Xiao Lan Curdt-Christiansen | University of Westminster
Info: Part of the English Language and Linguistics Research Seminar Series will be presenting a paper 'Factors influencing family language policy'. Family Language Policy (FLP) has received increasing attention in recent years. Of central interest is why some children, growing up in a bilingual environment, become monolinguals while other children, growing up in a monolingual society, become bilinguals. Over the past decades, researchers in this field have tried to understand the role FLP plays in bi/multilingual development by examining parental language ideologies, investigating interactions between family members, as well as studying parents’ conscious choices in their discourse strategies. As families are important social units in a given society, and caregivers’ and children’s beliefs, practices and interventions are consistently shaped by linguistic and non-linguistic factors associated with family resources, and broader socioeconomic, sociopolitical and sociocultural forces, resulting in either valuations or de-valuations of bi/multilingualism and multiculturalism. In this talk, I focus on factors influence the processes of family decisions on what languages to maintain and develop, and what languages to let go. Using empirical studies from recent research across different geopolitical contexts, I will demonstrate how internal and external factors are instantiated through parental beliefs and translated into language practices in children’s bi/multilingual development.

Info: Part of the English Language and Linguistics Research Seminar Series , The Open University, will be presenting a paper on ‘Using social networks to better understand the acquisition of sociolinguistic competence’. ‘Why do some migrants acquire more local dialect features in a new language than others?’ This overarching aim of this paper is to contribute to answering this outstanding question. Research addressing the language acquisition of migrants shows that migrants can acquire systematisation of variables, and therefore sociolinguistic competence, in a new language (Schleef et al., 2011). Yet, even when multiple variables such as age, and gender are held constant, we find a very broad range of inter-speaker variation. Scholars have identified that social networks may have an impact on the acquisition of sociolinguistic competence (Lybeck 2002; Schleef et al. 2011; Drummond 2013). However, these studies typically employ Labovian methodologies, and social networks are not their central focus. As a result, these pieces of research have only been able to make tentative suggestions as to the potential impact of social networks, and more focused studies that use participant observation, the methodology best-suited to the investigation of social networks, are still needed. Here, I present findings of a mixed methods investigation of the relationship between the social networks of adolescent Roma migrants attending high school in Manchester and their production of vowels in English. Qualitative, ethnographic observations gathered over a two-year period are used to contextualise quantitative phonetic analysis of speech data. The analyses address vocalic variation in the lettER and GOOSE vowels. Predictably, results show high levels of inter-speaker variation, even among speakers with comparable age of arrival, gender, and family membership. However, examination of participants’ friendship networks reveals a statistically significant relationship between more vernacular variation and more diverse (or open) friendship groups. The results of the study confirm the suggestions of earlier research that social networks are indeed a key variable in migrant dialect acquisition in a new language. In addition, the study demonstrates how examination of social networks can be a valuable lens through which to study migrants’ dialect acquisition. Looking at a speaker’s social networks can bring together a number of factors that can be difficult to quantify, such as language input and use (Flege 1987, 2007). It can also provide us with a more nuanced picture of migrants’ language use and further the field with a more fine-grained understanding of why some speakers acquire more local dialect features than others.

Title: Visual metaphor and the representation of migrants in political cartoons - Anna Piata | University of Westminster
Info: Part of the English Language and Linguistics Research Seminar Series , University of Neuchâtel, will be presenting a paper on 'Visual metaphor and the representation of migrants in political cartoons'. The use of metaphors has long been considered a prominent strategy used to legitimise social processes of othering (cf. Reisigl & Wodak 2001; Baker et al. 2008; KhosraviNik 2010; Musolff 2015). A case in point is the way we commonly talk about migration; in terms of a ‘flood’, a ‘wave’ and/or a ‘tide’, which essentially evokes a dehumanising representation of migrants and refugees (see Abid et al. 2017 and references therein). This talk will shift the focus from verbal to visual metaphor, and the ways in which visual metaphor has been used to represent the refugee crisis in political cartoons that have appeared in both online and traditional media from 2015 until 2018. On the assumption that “visual framing may convey meanings that would be more controversial or might meet with greater audience resistance if they were conveyed through words” (Messaris & Abraham 2001: 215), this study seeks to explore the potential of visual metaphor as a device that can be used to communicate both inclusive and anti-migrant sentiments alike. Our findings suggest that the visual framing, implicit as it may be, is often dehumanising and/or based on narratives that perpetuate a negative stereotypical representation of the relevant population. Against this background, the talk will tentatively consider the extent to which visual metaphor can be (consciously or subconsciously) used to solidify the dichotomy of ‘us versus them’ and discuss possible implications for the manipulative potential of metaphor at large.

Title: Conducting multilingual classroom research with refugee children: opportunities and challenges - Alexandra Georgiou | University of Westminster
Info: Part of the English Language and Linguistics Research Seminar Series , UCL Institute of Education, will be presenting a paper 'Conducting multilingual classroom research with refugee children: opportunities and challenges'. As a result of the recent refugee crisis, classrooms around the world are now becoming more linguistically and culturally diverse. This is a phenomenon that has not been fully examined yet and requires the employment of multilingual methodological approaches. In this presentation, I use a post-reflective account to discuss the challenges and opportunities occurred when conducting research with multilingual participants whose language and culture I did not share. The seven participants of my PhD research -where the data for this presentation are extracted from- were newly arrived refugees from war-torn countries, including Syria, Iraq, Iran and Somalia. Their linguistic repertoire included Arabic and Farsi, whereas the majority of their peers, their teachers and myself were speakers of Greek. I analyse how a repertoire approach towards multilingualism (Blommaert & Backus, 2013; Busch, 2015) when collecting and representing data, allowed me to create opportunities for ensuring linguistic equity between the languages observed in the fieldwork and authenticity of participants’ voices. The findings should be of particular importance to early career researchers and educators working in the fields of classroom ethnography, language and education.

Title: How Portuguese is sold as a tool for the future: heritage languages stocked into their past  Fabio Scetti | University of Westminster
Info: Part of the English Language and Linguistics Research Seminar Series , Université Paul-Valéry Montpellier & McGill University will present a paper on ‘How Portuguese is sold as a tool for the future: heritage languages stocked into their past’. This communication aims to underline the position of Portuguese language within two contexts of migration, in Canada and in the United States. Based on ethnographic research concerning two different Portuguese communities, in Montreal, Quebec and in Bridgeport, Connecticut, we intend to observe how the change in terms of migration dynamics has influenced the process of transmission of Portuguese within the groups, in the contemporary global society. Field research was carried out within the two communities between 2011 and 2018. The two contexts were chosen because they are very different from each other. In fact, in Bridgeport, English is the only dominant language, while in Montreal this shares the public environment with French. First, we observed how local institutions, within the groups, play the role of promoters of the Portuguese language and culture, considering the dominant variety of European Portuguese (EP) as the only norm of prestige to promote. Secondly, we analysed how Portuguese has changed during the process of transmission, in a context of Language Contact, with English or both English and French. Using language policy analysis at institutional, family and individual levels, we aim to explore how perceptions of the EP norm, focusing on individuals’ self-reported repertoires, can influence processes of integration in the new context. However, we may focus on how policy of transmission of the Heritage language change from one generation to another due to this process. Join at the correct time via Contact for more information.

Their work includes significant infrastructure projects such as the new station at Barking Riverside, the centrepiece of a massive regeneration scheme. Other recent rail projects include two new stations on the Elizabeth Line (Crossrail) at Woolwich and Paddington Station. The Paddington project has been described by the client as “…the jewel in the Crossrail crown.” When Chris was asked to work with Andrew Weston for group projects at Leicester School of Architecture (for no other reason than they were next to each other alphabetically) he discovered that their skills didn’t overlap but dovetailed perfectly. Their shared ambition made for a perfect business partnership. Forty years later Chris manages and directs the studio and has recently published WW+P’s vision for the next 20 years, which talks about a diverse, collaborative design studio with strong delivery skills. In addition to being a chartered architect, Chris has an MSc in Project Management and believes strongly that the art of architecture requires excellent business skills in order to be realised. Chris has recently been the International Vice President of the RIBA responsible for setting a strategy to grow into a global membership institution and to encourage more UK architects to seek work globally.

Title: A Zine of Collective Care: Covid-19 & Racism  Workshop 2 | University of Westminster
Info: 'A Zine of Collective Care: Covid-19 & Racism' is a digital zine workshop centred on sharing as nourishment and creativity as healing. In a time when racism is increasing against Chinese and South East Asian bodies, this hostility surrounds the mind and spirit of those bodies during this pandemic. This digital Zoom workshop offers a restorative space of collective sharing through art and zine making. The process of zine making creates a place to hear each other, amplify voices and build from a place of collective care. As Audre Lorde says, "Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare." This workshop is a part of a wider series of workshops exploring themes of care through food and nourishment, intergenerational intimacy, and the body itself. Your creative response to these ideas will form a shareable digital zine. The racialised framing of Covid-19 has thrown a heightened visibility to bodies of Chinese and Asian heritage. This visibility is a stark contrast to the historical invisibility of those very bodies in daily life. Against the dominant homogenising media outlet, this workshop offers a space to creatively intervene with the stereotypical projections that circulates in mainstream media. Through creative collaborative writing and collage, this workshop centres on unravelling the multiple threads and questions related to belonging.

The event will feature two talks: ; and . PACT is a collaboration led by the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), MIT Internet Policy Research Initiative, Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Global Health and MIT Lincoln Laboratory. It includes close collaborators from many other public and private research and development centers and is a partnership among cryptographers, physicians, privacy experts, scientists and engineers. Our mission is to maximize the utility of exposure detection functions in personal digital communication devices such that they can enhance and augment existing contact tracing strategies while preserving privacy. In this talk, we will provide a brief background of the COVID-19 pandemic and how automated contact tracing might fit into the overall fight against its spread, we will discuss and assess technical approaches for using smartphone technology to detect contact exposure events while preserving privacy, and we will report on PACT’s impact to date and the road ahead. IEEE is a very reputable organization because, since over a century, many of its members have been at the forefront of very significant techno-scientific advances. By contrast, the tagline “advancing technology for humanity” is just 10 years old. The extension "for humanity" is far from trivial, if one admits that the development of technology, and partly also of science, is embedded in broader socio-economic processes. Under realistic circumstances, assuming that these processes would a priori benefit the entire humanity, or at least broader parts thereof, may prove wishful thinking. Logically, science and technology will serve the interests of the ones who determine and control the initial and boundary conditions of the socio-economic processes that drive forward the techno-scientific evolution, such as geopolitical considerations and market competition as well as financial and reputational incentives within the techno-scientific communities. This is probably the reason why as the speed of technological evolution follows a breathtaking exponential trajectory, the technology-caused extinction-level threats to humanity keep increasing, not decreasing. The speech will address the question whether and how IEEE, through its leadership and membership, recognize these challenges and - if yes - what are the programs and plans aiming at reducing the gap between aspirational declarations and reality, starting with the specific case of AI systems. .

Title: Radical Conservatism and Global Order - Jean-Franois Drolet | University of Westminster
Info: Part of the CSD Spring 2021 Seminar Series will be presenting the paper ‘Radical Conservatism and Global Order’. This talk will draw on a research project on radical conservatism and global order that Jean-François has been working on with Professor Michael C Williams from the University of Ottawa over the past three years or so. More specifically, it will reflect on a distinctively American articulation of radical conservative thought that goes by the name of ‘paleoconservatism’. Although relatively unknown in the mainstream media, this anti-establishment strain of right-wing thought has provided intellectual ammunition to a wide range of agents and ideological forces that have been challenging liberal orders since the mid-1980s. This includes the Tea Party, the Alt-Right, Trumpism and the European New Right. This seminar will take place online. . The is based in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Westminster.

Info: Part of the CSD Spring 2021 Seminar Series will be presenting the paper ‘Thinking capitalism in the 21st century: the tasks of radical critique’ In her new book Capitalism on Edge, Albena Azmanova observes that, while we have been discussing the crisis of capitalism in the aftermath of the 2008 financial meltdown, neoliberal capitalism has mutated into a new form marked by the massification of insecurity. Precarity, rather than inequality, is what ails the 99 per cent, she claims. This alters the political diagnosis (populism is not populism), raises the stakes for progressive politics (fighting inequality is beside the point) and changes the rules of the game for radical critique (we can think systemic change without crisis, revolution, or utopia).

Title: Engaging Sankara on the Ruins of Epistemicide - Olivia Umurerwa Rutazibwa | University of Westminster
Info: Part of the CSD Spring 2021 Seminar Series Olivia Umurerwa Rutazibwa, Senior Lecturer International (Development) Studies, University of Portsmouth, UK / Senior Research Fellow, Johannesburg Institute for Advanced Study (JIAS) will present the paper ‘Engaging Sankara on the Ruins of Epistemicide: Discovering, Reporting and Teaching Thomas Sankara as Anticolonial Archive’. This paper is a collection of reflections on how we could engage Sankara as Anticolonial Archive (el-Malik and Kamola, 2017) and as/for wake work (Sharpe, 2017), for anticolonial knowledge making beyond personality cult, in a context of epistemicide (de Sousa Santos, 2014). An engagement with why he needed to be forgotten, who forgot and who not, and how he has been remembered, could point us in the direction of his dangerous, i.e. anticolonial, ideas and their stakes. This text offers three interventions: (1) I engage with my own discovery of the figure and ideas of Sankara to reflect on and illustrate epistemicide, as well as the places where the fissures are, i.e. there where the forgetting has not been successful; (2) I reflect on my journalistic attempt at curating and translating Sankara for a western audience – multidimensionally conceived – in the present, looking at pitfalls and opportunities (e.g. the need to frame him as the ‘African Che’ to make him readable in a context of profound colonial amnesia); (3) I explore Sankara’s words to (re-)think solidarity anticolonially, for the classroom and research agendas, zooming in on the idea of dignity (Agaciro) and the concrete case of Rwanda and the international aid context.

Title: Race, Caste and the Origins of Indian Diplomacy - Vineet Thakur | University of Westminster
Info: Part of the CSD Spring 2021 Seminar Series Vineet Thakur (Universiteit Leiden) will be presenting the paper ‘Race, Caste and the Origins of Indian Diplomacy’. After the end of the First World War, India emerged a quasi-international actor. Counter-intuitively to how IR literature understands domestic and international sovereignty, India’s international status was widely understood to be a precursor to internal autonomy. In the 1920s, as India - and indeed Indians - participated in various international platforms, the racial ill-treatment of Indians overseas and their rights became the most crucial issue for Indian diplomacy. In this talk that draws from his forthcoming diplomatic biography of V.S. Srinivasa Sastri, he looks at the emergence of Indian diplomacy in the early 1920s. Sastri was India’s roving ambassador in this period. The origins of Indian diplomacy, he argues, can only be understood through the intersection of three crucial identity and discursive markers: the commonwealth, race and – an issue that is never discussed in literature on Indian foreign policy – caste.

Info: Part of the CSD Spring 2021 Seminar Series Máximo Sozzo (Universidad Nacional del Litoral, Argentina) will be presenting the paper ‘“Southernizing” Criminology: Problems and Possibilities’. In recent years, expressions such as 'southern criminology', 'counter-colonial criminology' ‘decolonial criminology’ or 'postcolonial criminology' have occupied corners of the contemporary debate in this field of studies. This discussion echoes a general debate within social sciences. Not all these expressions mean exactly the same and there are important distinctions among the different interventions. In this paper Máximo tries to produce a balance of what has been discussed, highlighting some key elements around which there is some sort of agreement and identifying the main points of disagreement and the different arguments that have been proposed in relation to them. Finally, he discusses the idea of “southernizing” criminology as an interesting alternative to solve at least some – even if not all – these points of conflict, both politically and scientifically.

Title: Queer Chimerica: Global China and the Political Economy of Ku'er | University of Westminster
Info: Part of the CSD Spring 2021 Seminar Series Dr Shana Ye (University of Toronto) will present the paper 'Queer Chimerica: Global China and the Political Economy of Ku'er'. What's the relationship between queer fluidity and capital’s demands for labour fluidity and flexibility? Queer theorisation is often thought of as being originated from French poststructuralist critique of gender and sexual identities and the US-based LGBT social movement. This talk traces a third genealogy of "queer" by examining the ways in which the production of queerness and the development of LGBT industry are inseparable of Cold War racial capitalism and labour precarity, exemplified by the post-Cold War interdependence of China and United States. Treating "queer" as a set of material relations of capital and labour mediated by geopolitics and affect, this talk argues that the maintenance of a Cold War divide is crucial to sustain the transnational “queer business” and to conceal inequality enabled by the alliance of democratic and authoritarian neoliberalism.

Title: A battle, a tsunami or a raging fire? Metaphors for Covid-19 and why they matter - Veronika Koller | University of Westminster
Info: The Westminster Forum for Language and Linguistics is delighted to announce their annual lecture for 2021 with of Lancaster University. In this lecture, I first outline different aspects of language use during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as neologisms, and then focus on metaphor. Discussing the multiple functions of metaphor in discourse, I make a case for studying the ways metaphor conceptualises the various aspects of the pandemic, including the coronavirus, infections, government measures and their consequences, and vaccination. The second part of the talk introduces the #ReframeCovid initiative that started in March 2020 in order to crowdsource alternatives to the war metaphors so prevalent in public discourses on Covid-19 in different contexts around the world. I provide details on how the initiative started and developed, and what metaphors are most frequent among its ca. 500 examples from about 30 languages. This discussion also addresses how cultural and political context can influence the choice of metaphor. In the final part of the lecture, I present insights from multidisciplinary metaphor studies to argue what makes a “good”, ie apt, metaphor for an event as complex and dynamic as a pandemic. In accordance with the title, particular attention will be given to metaphors of war, natural disasters and fire. I conclude with a brief discussion of what the Covid-19 case can tell us about communication and language use during public health crises.

Title: Propagating contact-induced language change: how English was Frenchified - Richard Ingham, University of Westminster | University of Westminster
Info: The Westminster Forum for Language and Linguistics is delighted to present a lecture by our Visiting Professor, Richard Ingham, University of Westminster Conventional accounts of French borrowing into Middle English highlights high-status occupations and activities as areas where linguistic contact would have occurred (eg Kastovsky 2006, Barber, Beal and Shaw 2009, Minkova and Stockwell 2009). Rothwell’s (1998) revisionist approach emphasises rather the role of educated, literate communities. Inevitably, little or no evidence survives from that time of the everyday sociolinguistic interactions that would have enacted contact influence. In this paper the textual record itself is used to address this deficiency indirectly, studying two types of lexical innovation that left their mark on English. We first focus on the clergy, a subgroup that has left some record of the language in which they communicated with an ordinary English-speaking public. English clerics received a Francophone-medium school education (Orme 1973), which would have familiarised them with the French vocabulary used for religious instruction in preaching, in chantry schools and beyond.  Two late 13th c. religious texts intended for the laity were analysed for their use of lexis. An analysis of variant forms in the Cursor Mundi, native and French-origin, found that the latter would go on to replace native items the majority of the time.  The clergy’s use of French-origin items may well have initially introduced and then maintained them in at least the receptive competence of English speakers. A 30,000-word sample from the Early South English Legendary was also analysed. One new French-derived lexical type, from quite diverse semantic fields, occurred nearly every 10 lines, implying familiarity among the audience with a wide range of French-origin items, including many not belonging to high-status activities. Evidently, a substantial amount of French-origin vocabulary was considered suitable for didactic use with layfolk, instead of native-origin lexis. The clergy are taken to have acted as an important agency of lexical change. We also envisage a significant contact influence process that created a register of Middle English used by French-dominant speakers. Use is made of van Coetsem’s (2000) concept of lexical change arising from ‘imposition’ of source-language lexis on a recipient language by non-native speakers of it. This is investigated in the domain of verb vocabulary. Middle English saw large-scale adoption of French-origin mental activity verbs taking clausal complements (Los 2005). The disappearance of nearly all such Old English verbs is compared with physical activity verbs in the Bilingual Thesaurus of Everyday Life in Medieval England (Sylvester, Marcus & Ingham 2016), revealing a much higher survival rate of OE verbs with agent-affect-patient semantics. The high vulnerability to replacement of OE mental activity verbs is discussed in terms of Ingham’s (2017) interpersonal cognition hypothesis, according to which lexical items denoting events requiring metalinguistic judgment of the speech or mental activity being performed are harder to acquire/borrow than those with a physical denotation (Papafragou, Cassidy, and Gleitman, 2007). French speakers acquiring English after the Norman conquest would thus have been led to largely relexicalise the clausal complement-taking verb inventory on French lines, whilst acquiring English verb lexis more successfully for semantic categories with physical denotations.

Title: The Many Faces of Migration: An Interdisciplinary Unconference | University of Westminster
Info: The timings are subject to change. HOMELandS and the University Research Communities A defining feature of the twenty-first century is the unprecedented movement of peoples across national borders and the consequences this has produced. Migration is one of the most visible aspects of globalisation and has a significant impact on the human landscape. Within the University of Westminster, many colleagues specialise in migration-related research. We want to create a University-wide platform to bring together colleagues from across colleges and schools, who are interested in migration studies, to connect with each other and to celebrate what we have achieved. By organising this event, we hope to achieve the following objectives: We adopt the term ‘unconference’ as the most suitable format for this University-wide capacity-building event. We welcome academic papers, posters, exhibition pieces, musical works, poetry, unconventional presentations of on-going research, all of which celebrate the many faces of migration. We encourage contributors to share their work, experiences and ideas in a relaxed, non-hierarchical setting, to generate innovative ideas to further migration research. We define ‘migration’ broadly, referring to the diverse experiences associated with trans-border and trans-national mobilities. We expect this two-day virtual unconference to comprise panel discussions, interactive roundtables, an online exhibition and other knowledge-sharing and co-creative activities. As a starting point, the facilitators have identified five interrelated themes around which the issue of migration is already being researched. These themes provide a working structure in which migration, with its many faces, can be opened up and explored further. We want to identify synergies between all themes and to reveal shared interests that have the potential to lead to rich and fruitful collaborations. Please find a description of each theme and the contact details of theme facilitators through the Padlet link below. your contribution(s), in whatever form they take, to the relevant theme or the open contributions strand of this (access is for staff and doctoral students of the University of Westminster). Further guidance on using Padlet is provided on . contact Terry Lamb: or Cangbai Wang: .

Title: Creating Decolonial Atmospheres in the Classroom | University of Westminster
Info: Decolonisation of the curricula exceeds material changes to what we teach. It asks, also, that we transform the ‘coloniality of being’ embodied experiences of dehumanisation. But how can we, as teachers, disrupt interpersonal transmissions of coloniality in the classroom and beyond? This session will explore the value of working to create ‘decolonial atmosphere’s’ in order to remake our teacher-student relationships along decolonial lines. We will discuss the meaning and markers of decolonial atmospheres and how this praxis can be engaged with. A critical reading of 'A Pedagogical Response to Decoloniality: Decolonial Atmospheres and Rising Subjectivity' is useful but not a pre-requite to engage in this dialogue. Maldonado-Torres, N. (2007). On the coloniality of being: Contributions to the development of a concept1. Cultural Studies (London, England), 21(2-3), 240–270. https://doi.org/10.1080/09502380601162548 Bell, D. (2018).

She holds a PhD in Depth Psychology with a specialism in community psychology, liberation psychology and ecopsychology from Pacifica Graduate Institute. Deanne’s work focuses on social transformation given the reality of social suffering, structural violence and collective trauma the majority world experience. She uses a decolonial framework both within the university where she is involved with decolonising the university and more broadly where she continues to study how we bystand social suffering. She has recently launched a research project titled 'The Anatomy of Indifference and Care'. The session will be hosted on Zoom. (Meeting ID: 853 0397 0684. Passcode: 227713)

Jason is an Associate Professor in Sociology at Durham University in the Department of Sociology and the Deputy Executive Dean for People and Culture in the Faculty of Social Science and Health. He is a Visiting Research Fellow at The Ohio State University in the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, an Adjunct Professor at Nelson Mandela University in the Centre for Critical Studies in Higher Education Transformation and a Trustee of the Runnymede Trust, the UK’s leading Race Equality Thinktank. Jason is also a Trustee of the British Sociological Association (BSA) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts (RSA). He sits on the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (CLASS) National Advisory Panel and is a School Governor at Shaftesbury Park Primary School in London. Damien is Professor of Health Studies and Research Director (College of Liberal Arts and Sciences), University of Westminster. He previously worked in the Health Experiences Research Group (HERG) at the University of Oxford. There, he began his research that fleshed out for the first time what recovery from depression actually entailed for patients, thus moving the field beyond rhetoric advocating a general 'recovery approach,' by providing signposts as to what that practice might be about. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidance on depression subsequently adopted his research on recovery extensively in their guidance on the treatment and management of depression in adults in the UK (2010). The current consultation (2018) also uses his work to bring about deeper understanding of patient experiences, including good treatment approaches and useful approaches to recovery.

Url: https://www.westminster.ac.uk/current-students/events/ageing-hiv-and-social-support
Title: Ageing, HIV, and social support | University of Westminster
Info: 'Ageing, HIV, and social support' is a presentation event by Dana Rosenfeld, Senior Research Fellow at the Health Innovation Ecosystem (HIE) hub. HIE is a hub for research, student engagement, and academic enterprise activity related to health and wellbeing. The 'Ageing, HIV, and social support' event is part of its spring seminar series. Ageing with HIV introduces distinctive stressors, from uncertainty over ageing with HIV's clinical and social implications to experiencing two intersecting stigmas: HIV-related stigma, and ageism. As with other groups living with stigmatized health conditions, the question of how 'formal' and 'informal' support can help to mitigate these stressors is a pressing one. Yet the literature on social support suffers from a failure to fully consider the complexities that stigmatization introduces to the social worlds of stigmatized groups. Drawing on data from focus groups and interviews with older (aged 50+) white men who have sex with men (MSM), and black African and white heterosexual men and women, living with HIV, this presentation explores participants' own approaches to and experiences of securing social support. Applying Erving Goffman's classic work on stigma, I discuss participants' distinctions between support from HIV-negative people (what Goffman would term the 'wise') and from other people living with HV (what Goffman would term 'the own'). While participants valued support from the wise, they also sought support from 'the own', yet access to 'the own' varied across participant groups. The presentation concludes by considering these findings' implications for research into social support among people living with stigmatizing health conditions.

Title: BUIRA History of Industrial Relations Study Group - Working Mothers: 150 Years of Unpaid Care Work and Paid Employment | University of Westminster
Info: A McKinsey Report (2020) recently concluded that women’s jobs were globally more at risk as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic than men’s, first because women are more likely to act as unpaid carers than men, and second because women work disproportionately in those sectors most vulnerable to decline (such as retail, hotels and catering). This seminar examines the division commonly made between unpaid care work and paid employment in historical and global perspective, particularly in the light of the pandemic, and its implications for equality at work. It also investigates the perception of unpaid care work as lacking value and esteem. This paper focuses on the thought of Beatrice Webb (1858-1943) and how it related to the life she led as the daughter of an upper-class industrialist who moved through the worlds of philanthropy, social investigation and socialist agitation between the 1880s and the end of the First World War. The paper suggests the value of adopting a biographical lens for understanding how beliefs about gender and the family become embedded in labour markets and social policies. Drawing together the genres of feminist life-writing and intellectual biography, it explores the formation of such beliefs at the level of the individual, from the psychic processes shaping Webb’s interior self to the political and intellectual cultures through which she made her public mark. ‘Indispensable to All Working Women and to Mothers in the Home’: that is how the French organizer of garment outworkers Jeanne Bouvier characterized a proposal for an eight-hour day, forty-eight-hour week which a century ago became Convention No.1 of the newly formed International Labour Organization (ILO). In differentiating ‘mother in the home’ from ‘all working women,’ she reinforced the separation of mother work (care) from the world of employment that has haunted the formulation of global labour standards. Until the 2000s, paid care work mostly stood outside of ILO deliberations, while unpaid family care was seen predominantly as a special kind of activity, one performed out of love or duty. Whether the new care work economy, especially during COVID times, touted by the ILO as central for gender equality, merely relabels the old inequalities will depend on the struggles waged in its name. For further details or to reserve a place, please e-mail Michael Gold ( ) or Linda Clarke ( ). We’ll send the Zoom link a few days before the seminar to those who have reserved a place. ProBE (Centre for the Study of the Production of the Built Environment) is ideally placed to organise this symposium as a joint research centre between Westminster Business School (WBS) and the School of Architecture and the Built Environment (ABE), committed to the development of a rich programme of research and related activities, including projects, oral history, film, exhibitions, and seminars.

Title: Rethinking Neville Chamberlain | University of Westminster
Info: Andrew Crozier argues we need to rethink our understanding of Neville Chamberlain, his policies and the nature and objectives of appeasement. Neville Chamberlain has been indelibly associated with appeasement since his death in 1940. Yet what Chamberlain meant by appeasement has been largely (and sometimes deliberately) obscured. For instance, he was arguing for regime change in Germany as the only basis for a settlement from the summer of 1939, before the outbreak of war. Andrew Crozier is Distinguished Research Scholar at New York University and his publications include Appeasement and Germany's Last Bid for Colonies (1988) and The Causes of the Second World War (1997). In this foretaste of his forthcoming new biography of Neville Chamberlain, he argues that we need to reappraise the character and the policies of this controversial figure. This includes not only his preparations for war in the 1930s, but also his rejection of area bombing, and the relationship between his economic policies as Chancellor of the Exchequer 1931-37 and the ideas then being promoted by John Maynard Keynes.

Title: Museum Representations of Chinese Diasporas: Migration Histories and the Cultural Heritage of the Homeland | University of Westminster
Info: In this event, author Dr Cangbai Wang (University of Westminster, United Kingdom) will talk about his research findings with guest discussant Associate Professor Yow Cheun Hoe (Nanyang Technological University, Singapore). Museum Representations of Chinese Diasporas is the first book to analyse the recent upsurge in museums on Chinese diasporas in China. Examining heritage-making beyond the nation state, the book provides a much-needed, critical examination of China’s engagement with its diasporic communities. Drawing on fieldwork in more than ten museums, as well as interviews with museum practitioners and archival study, Wang offers a timely analysis of the complex ways in which Chinese diasporas are represented in the museum space of China, the ancestral homeland. Arguing that diasporic heritage is highly ambivalent and introducing a diasporic perspective to the study of cultural heritage, this book opens up a new avenue of inquiry into the study and management of cultural heritage in China and beyond. Wang sheds new light on the dynamic between China and Chinese diasporas through the lens of the museum. Museum Representations of Chinese Diasporas takes a transnational perspective that will draw attention to the under-researched connections between heritage, mobility and meaning in a global context. As such, this cross-disciplinary work will be of interest to scholars and students working in the museum and heritage studies fields, as well as those studying Asia, China, migration and diaspora, anthropology, history and culture. This event is organised by Contemporary China Centre and HOMELandS (Hub on Migration, Exile, Language and Spaces). This event is free to attend but you must register your place in advance.

Title: Undercover - From necessity to luxury: The evolution of face coverings during COVID-19 | University of Westminster
Info: Opening on 11 May 2021 (one year on from when the UK government first advised people to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces), the exhibition will explore how masks have evolved from being a functional PPE object in short supply, to becoming an everyday object worn by millions. The simple cloth face covering, which appears to be an unassuming and uncomplicated object, has quickly become a symbolic and contentious artefact. The exhibition will present 52 unique face covers arranged in chronological order.

Title: Undercover - From necessity to luxury: The evolution of face coverings during COVID-19 | University of Westminster
Info: Opening on 11 May 2021 (one year on from when the UK government first advised people to wear face coverings in enclosed public spaces), the exhibition will explore how masks have evolved from being a functional PPE object in short supply, to becoming an everyday object worn by millions. The simple cloth face covering, which appears to be an unassuming and uncomplicated object, has quickly become a symbolic and contentious artefact. The exhibition will present 52 unique face covers arranged in chronological order. It will examine how rapidly the fashion industry adapted production, manufacturing, and online marketing to meet changing consumer demands. Brands responded quickly to support the global effort to produce PPE for medical personnel.

Title: Central London BUIRA Seminar: Higher education, marketisation, REF/TEF and employment relations | University of Westminster
Info: This virtual London BUIRA seminar is focused on changes in higher education and their implications for employment relations and we are fortunate to have two expert speakers. The seminar begins with considerations by Dorothy Bishop of the history of how the Research Excellence Framework and Teaching Excellence Frameworks came into being, the rationale for their development and their subsequent evolution into their current forms. Public accountability and transparency in the allocation of funds was the stated motivation for developing the REF, but it has since taken over other roles, and now is used as a management tool. The stated reason for needing a Teaching Excellence Framework was to force universities to take teaching more seriously, and to provide information for prospective students. In practice, both REF and TEF have had unintended consequences, and in both cases, there are reasons to question the validity of the processes used to allocate rankings. Dorothy will be followed by Olga Kuznetsova who will speak about her research with Prof Andrei Kuznetsov, published as: ‘And then there were none: what a UCU Archive tells us about employee relations in marketising universities’ in Studies in Higher Education. The study engages evidence from a University and College Union branch archive to explore developments in employee relations (ER) that reflect the organisation-level effects of marketisation of UK universities. The evidence exposes points of strain in ER at a level of professional divide between managers and academics and helps to understand their root. It also reveals new ethical challenges (some of which are connected to the demands and constraints put by REF and TEF) faced by the academic profession and individual academics. Some recent reflections will be drawn on the meaning of 'distant' and 'distance' in management. The seminar is an opportunity to air and discuss these issues in an open forum and consider their implications for industrial relations. Anyone interested is welcome to attend. For further details and to reserve a place, contact Linda Clarke ( ), who will send you a link before the seminar. ProBE (Centre for the Study of the Production of the Built Environment) is ideally placed to organise this symposium as a joint research centre between Westminster Business School (WBS) and the School of Architecture and the Built Environment (ABE), committed to the development of a rich programme of research and related activities, including projects, oral history, film, exhibitions, and seminars.

Title: Beyond Home and Exile - Film Screening and Q&A | University of Westminster
Info: Live Film Screening and Q&A with documentary filmmaker and photographer Maren Hahnfeld. Chaired by Camille Waring. Batoul’s Journey (2020) and Shadows in the Dark (2021) investigate the lives of Syrian refugee women in remote towns in Germany. Both films depict Syrians who are in the process of building a new home and address the lack of representation of female refugees in media and academic research. This lack is magnified outside of large cities and for this reason Hahnfeld’s work focuses on Muslim women who have fled Syria between 2015-17 and now live in small towns in Germany. These women have lived for a number of years in their adopted home country and both films explore how these new citizens build a life in exile, form relationships with locals and the impact they have on their new communities.

Info: Student panel discussion - hear from a range of current doctoral students from backgrounds that are underrepresented in doctoral education. We know that access to and a successful and positive experience of doctoral study is not equally available to all. Much recent research has shown that those from disadvantaged socio-economic groups, from minoritised ethnic groups, those with disabilities and others from non-traditional backgrounds are much less likely to enter doctoral programmes, to be funded and to successfully complete their PhD. The University of Westminster is very proud of the diversity of its doctoral student community, but we know that there is much more to be done in getting rid of barriers to access. In these interviews and panel, you will hear from a range of current doctoral students from backgrounds that are underrepresented in doctoral education — about their experiences, their routes to doctoral study, their advice and guidance for others thinking of doing a PhD, their challenges to the status quo in higher education.

This can be of interest to researchers in many fields. We will also consider the practice of the preservation and restoration of these collections, the cataloguing of associated metadata and contextual information, and making the material accessible to students and researchers and online.  Westminster has a scanning and restoration facility with a Lasergraphics 5K scanner and Phoenix restoration software. We will schedule hands-on workshops for those that want them, to demystify film scanning and allow participants to scan a film from their own archive, with professional support.

Url: https://www.westminster.ac.uk/events/central-london-buira-seminar-the-transforming-employment-relation
Title: Central London BUIRA Seminar: The transforming employment relation | University of Westminster
Info: This virtual London BUIRA seminar is focused on the transformation of the employment relation and we are fortunate to have two expert speakers. Valeria Pulignano addresses the challenge posed by the growth of precarious work to generate significant rethinking of the future directions of work. Especially, it requires a focus on the increasing importance of ‘grey zones’ at the interface between the sphere of public (paid) work and private home (domestic) work. Between these two spheres, a series of ‘grey zones’ is emerging, characterised by work that is unpaid but necessary to engage in the public sphere of paid work. At the same time, this work relies on a private sphere that can support such ‘grey zones’, often by making the domestic sphere more oriented to the marketability of its participants. A distinctive framework is presented for understanding the reconfiguration of precarious work. This is followed by Patricia Leighton, who will speak about her recent book with Tui McKeown, (2020). This identified a range of issues, from ‘fragmentation’ in relationships, health and wellbeing, insecurities, skills development and the use of technology. COVID-19 has worsened the position of those already precarious in areas such as hospitality, ‘bank nurses’, supply teachers and interpreters. The Taylor Report, 2017, proposed new ‘rights’ to redress the situation but legislation has had limited effect, especially with COVID and with contract law limiting protections and liabilities. This raises the question: Is it better to impose duties and responsibilities on the beneficiaries of labour markets than provide hard to enforce rights and will new types of unionism have a key role to play? Valeria Pulignano is Professor of Sociology at the Center for Sociological Research (CESO) at KU Leuven. Her research lies in employment (industrial) relations and labour markets, their changing nature and implications for voice at work and inequality as differences in wages, working conditions, job quality and wellbeing. She is currently coordinating an research project on “Resolving Precariousness: Advancing the Theory and Measurement of Precariousness Across the Paid/Unpaid Continuum” and she is also Partner in the EU WorkYP “Working and Yet Poor”. Among her recent books is Shifting Solidarities (2020, Palgrave-MacMillan) with I Van Hoyweghen and G Meyers. Patricia Leighton is Professor Emeritus at the University of South Wales, UK – former Jean Monnet Professor of European Law. She is currently Professor of European Law at the IPAG Business School, France and a member of their research group. Her research and publishing interests are employment relationships, atypical contracts and self-employment. She has undertaken a wide range of projects funded by governmental and public bodies including the European Commission and ILO, and is the author of several books on employment contracts and their management. The seminar is an opportunity to air and discuss these issues in an open forum and consider their implications for industrial relations. Anyone interested is welcome to attend.

Title: Westminster Degree Shows 2021 | University of Westminster
Info: Join us from Saturday, 12 June for the launch of the University of Westminster first online cross-school degree show Westminster Degree Show 2021. The website is meant as a platform (a large online catalogue) showcasing student projects from Westminster School of Arts and Westminster School of Media and Communications. The platform will align with London Fashion Week, with live events happening on the website from different courses from 14 June onwards. Access the degree shows and events via the Westminster Degree Shows 2021 website. One of the joys of working in art and design education are the annual shows. They provide a moment of educational achievement, personal closure and community celebration all in one. Like art and design courses all around the country, to finish off our degrees we put the work up in front of the public that it was intended for, have friends and family admire and criticise it, employers or curators make offers because of it, and share our mutual struggles across three years with all those who participated in it: students, families, technicians and tutors alike. Our fear, as a School, was that we wouldn’t be able to create this moment of completion in the shadow of Covid-19. As teachers and technicians, we have watched as students have found creative workarounds and proposed alternatives to conventional ways of making and presenting their work during 15 months of Covid restrictions. These are the most unusual circumstances any of us have ever experienced for creative practice, and students have consistently met the challenge of making and presenting in its wake. I understand the sacrifices this has required and pressure it has created, and am in awe of the commitment students have shown to their studies. Most of our courses have devised their own ways of finding the public this work deserves. Our online show is just a part of that. Fashion Design have made some stunning films, Fine Art have managed a socially distanced physical exhibition, Contemporary Media Practice have their 3D website and Film will show in the cinema in autumn. However, we also thought it was important to collect our students’ work and present it for you in total. The achievements gathered here reflect the diversity of subjects, our student body and their aspirations. There is plenty here for all to be proud of, and to provide the sense of completion that our students deserve.

Title: BUIRA History of Industrial Relations Study Group: Has a standard contract of employment ever existed? An historical overview from the UK | University of Westminster
Info: The aim of this seminar is to establish the antecedents of casual employment in the history of IR in the light of the Uber case. Many people still see the full-time open-ended employment contract as 'standard', which of course it often is, but the accompanying assumption - that casual employment is somehow anomalous - is clearly misplaced. In this seminar we explore the development of both ‘standard’ and casual employment in a longer-term time frame, going back to the 19th century. 5-5.15pm: Welcome and introduction: Michael Gold and Linda Clarke (Chairs) 5.15 – 5.45pm: Simon Deakin Legal concepts are linguistic artefacts which have a function (classification for the purposes of legislation and adjudication) and a history (they are shaped by path dependent forces). The English legal term ‘employment’ has a history that helps us to understand the uses it is being put to today. A comparative overview, taking into account mainland European ‘work’ relationships (contrat de travail, Arbeitsverhältnis) and the US ‘ABC’ test of employment status, are also helpful for putting into perspective recent developments, including the Supreme Court judgment in Uber (Feb. 2021). 5.45 – 6.15pm: Noel Whiteside This presentation re-examines assumptions about ‘standard’ employment and its prevalence. Reappraising forms of employment found in the UK since the late nineteenth century, it demonstrates how casual working practices and flexible hours characterised substantial sections of the UK economy prior to the second world. From this perspective, the 1950s and 1960s appear exceptional. The presentation concludes, with recent legal judgements, that work contracts do not necessarily reflect the realities of precarious employment; that security of job tenure does not equate to security of earnings; that official categories of labour market analysis are, at best, misleading - and that multiple problems face those who would reform the situation. For finally, what does ‘employment’ mean? 6.15 – 6.45pm: Discussion and Close For further details or to reserve a place, please e-mail Michael Gold ( ) or Linda Clarke ( ). We’ll send you the Zoom link a few days before the seminar. Simon Deakin: Professor of Law at Cambridge University and Director of the . He is co-author of which will appear in a new edition (the 7th) in the summer of 2021. Recent publications include: Noel Whiteside: Professor at the University of Warwick Institute for Employment Research, an emerita Professor in sociology (Warwick) and a visiting Professor at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment (University of Oxford). Her research focuses on labour markets and labour market policies in historical and comparative perspective, previously assisted by a variety of European and UK research awards. Recent publications include: ‘Casual employment and its consequences: an historical appraisal of recent labour market trends’ Historical Studies in Industrial Relations, 40, 2019: 1-26. is ideally placed to organise this symposium as a joint research centre between Westminster Business School (WBS) and the School of Architecture and the Built Environment (ABE), committed to the development of a rich programme of research and related activities, including projects, oral history, film, exhibitions, and seminars.

Title: The EU, Hamas and the 2006 Palestinian Elections: Book launch and conversation | University of Westminster
Info: A book launch and conversation with Dr Catherine Chiniara Charrett Palestinian communities have used various methods to resist colonial expansion and establish an autonomous space. In the midst of dozens of competing explanations of the effectiveness of these methods, Catherine Chiniara Charrett focuses on the response of a third party actor, the European Union, to a landmark event. The 2006 legislative elections brought an entirely new development to the Palestinian territories: the unexpected victory of Hamas, which won 74 of 132 seats. And yet instead of seeing this as an opening and a new direction, the EU refused to work with Hamas, in defiance of its own previous efforts at democratic reform. Why? Why did the EU close a door that seemed to have just been opened? The consequences of the sanctions on Hamas and on Gaza are still ongoing, but how did such as diplomatic failure come about? Dr Charrett uses interviews and fieldwork with the involved parties to enter into the psychological states and performances that generated the negative response to the 2006 election, and helped set the conflict on its current course. They use performance art and theory to analyze and also rearticulate the political rituals that controlled the aftermath of the election. Their fieldwork reveals the extent to which EU officials disliked the positions they themselves were taking, and delves into the expectations that Hamas representatives had of their European counterparts. What happened when this gap between policy and affect opened into an explosive political situation? Dr. Charrett’s transdisciplinary methodology uses an original combination of interviews, analysis, and recreative performances to identify missed opportunities and affective capabilities that might enable better political engagements in the future. Dr Charrett will offer an overview of her book, to be followed by responses from: (Sheffield Hallam University), a writer, artist, activist and PhD student exploring Palestinian cinema; (Princeton University), a scholar of international law and formerly the UN special rapporteur to Palestine, and author of Palestine's Horizon: Toward a Just Peace (Pluto Press, 2017); (Bir Zeit University), whose book Palestinian Women's Activism: Nationalism, Secularism, Islamism was shortlisted for the 2019 Palestine Book Award; and (University of Glasgow), a specialist in issues of violence, security and policing with a strong focus on contemporary urban spaces. Your questions and a discussion will follow, moderated by Professor Christopher Newfield, ISRF Director of Research. All are welcome to attend and to participate.

Title: polysocial: an eclectic evening of music, poetry and literature | University of Westminster
Info: Join us for an eclectic evening of music, poetry and literature at The Social Produced by The Soho Poly and Disruptive Events. Pete Astor’s new music/poetry project The Attendant headlines the evening. A bold new departure for the gifted song writer (The Loft, the Weather Prophets), The Attendant was inspired by the space lockdown provided to look at new ways to frame some of his poetry. Pete is joined on stage by fellow members Ian Button (Death in Vegas, Go Kart Mozart) and Andy Lewis (Paul Weller, Soho Radio), playing live samples, drum box and bass. Richard Price's poetry is songlike and his songs are like poems. His Small World won the Scottish Poetry Book of the Year and Moon for Sale was a Guardian Pick of the Year, too. Hear him perform new work, including lyrics taken from his latest musical project The Loss Adjustors. Pete’s performance will also be supported by short readings from the Hannah Copley-led project Between the Lines, where lost female Olympic icons are reclaimed via poetry. Acclaimed author Michael Nath will also read an extract from his latest novel, The Treatment, which examines the aftermath of a racist murder in South London. With echoes of the Stephen Lawrence case, David Peace wrote recently in The Guardian that ‘it remains a mystery to me how that book did not win every prize going and top the bestseller list for a year’. Opening the event is a repeat of The Soho Poly’s New Order Ghost Gig, a playback of their locally recorded 1985 concert. polysocial is an offshoot of the Soho Poly Project and produced by Disruptive Events. Our mantra is that to disrupt your day with culture is a joy that should be available for everyone. Since 2017, we've been putting on performances, gigs, fanzine workshops, exhibitions and ghost gigs, all inspired by and emanating from our Soho Poly base, a literal (Olympic) stones’ throw from the social*, and largely at lunchtimes to give people the chance to disrupt their working day. Find out more about our . Recently we produced ‘Dance’, the first new Soho Poly play for 30 years, first online during the 2020 lockdown and then, in July 2021, physically at the Kings Head. The event at The Social will be the second major off-site venture for the Soho Poly. The Soho Poly was one of London’s most important alternative theatre venue between 1972 and 1990, a radical pioneer of lunchtime theatre and widening democratic access to the arts. This first polysocial does not disrupt time, but it does disrupt space, locating events for the first time in the basement of our fantastic local, The Social on Little Portland Street.  Tying in with our philosophy, this first event showcases the concept and celebrates our friends and collaborators. All of the collaborators are connected to the University of Westminster in some way. *if anyone would like to visit the Soho Poly you’d be more than welcome, ask Guy or Matt or keep an eye on our social media or website for public events or

Title: No Time to Die & In-person Q&A with BOND screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade | University of Westminster
Info: He’s back! The world’s most famous spy is finally returning to our screens, as Daniel Craig once again assumes the mantle of Bond. Join us on Thursday 14 October for a live, in-person interview with Robert Wade and Neal Purvis – the screenwriters of no fewer than seven BOND films, including THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, DIE ANOTHER DAY, CASINO ROYALE, QUANTUM OF SOLACE, SKYFALL, SPECTRE and NO TIME TO DIE.

Title: CAMRI Research Seminar: Matthew Flisfeder  Algorithmic Desire and the Ideology of Twenty-First Century Capitalism | University of Westminster
Info: Much has been written about the more deleterious dimensions of social media websites, platforms, and apps, from Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, to Instagram and Snapchat, dating apps like Tinder, and more recent apps like TikTok. We are all more than familiar with critiques of social media corporations and government surveillance, the commodification, expropriation and exploitation of user-provided data, the tailoring and curation of content, and of course recent dilemmas focused on fake news tying our use of social media to international cyber-warfare. Given all of these potential problems, why don’t we just give up and abandon our attachment to social media? How might we grapple with the exploitative and anti-democratic aspects of social media set against the kinds of enjoyment that it procures? Despite some of these problems, Matthew Flisfeder argues that social media helps us to grasp the coordinates, not merely of our trouble with machines and new media, but with the larger totality of twenty-first-century capitalism. Conceiving social media as a central metaphor for our historical present, Flisfeder proposes extending the concept to its fullest potentials. Instead of abandoning the concept, Flisfeder argues that the term social media helps us to render what is problematic about contemporary neoliberal capitalism, proposing that it is only by pursuing and failing to achieve a truly authentic social media as our goal that we are best positioned to understand the real contradictions of our time, as well as dominant forms of subjectivity, consciousness, and enjoyment. is an Associate Professor of Rhetoric and Communications at The University of Winnipeg (Canada).

Title: CAMRI Research Seminar: Gavin Mueller  Breaking Things at Work | University of Westminster
Info: In the nineteenth century, English textile workers responded to the introduction of new technologies on the factory floor by smashing them to bits. For years the Luddites roamed the English countryside, practising drills and manoeuvres that they would later deploy on unsuspecting machines. The movement has been derided by scholars as a backwards-looking and ultimately ineffectual effort to stem the march of history. For Gavin Mueller, the movement gets at the heart of the antagonistic relationship between all workers, including us today, and the so-called progressive gains secured by new technologies. The Luddites weren’t primitive and they are still a force, however unconsciously, in the workplaces of the twenty-first-century world. This talk is based on material from the book Breaking Things at Work, published by Verso in 2021. Breaking Things at Work is an innovative rethinking of labour and machines, leaping from textile mills to algorithms, from existentially threatened knife cutters of rural Germany to surveillance-evading truckers driving across the continental United States. Mueller argues that the future stability and empowerment of working-class movements will depend on subverting these technologies and preventing their spread wherever possible. The task is intimidating, but the seeds of this resistance are already present in the neo-Luddite efforts of hackers, pirates, and dark web users who are challenging surveillance and control, often through older systems of communication technology. is an Assistant Professor of New Media and Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam.

Title: CAMRI Research Seminar: Taina Bucher  Facebook | University of Westminster
Info: Facebook has fundamentally changed how the world connects. No other company has played a greater role in the history of social networking online. Yet Facebook is no longer simply a social networking site or social media platform. Facebook is Facebook. Taina Bucher shows how Facebook has become an idea of its own: something that cannot be fully described using broader categories. Facebook has become so commonplace that most people have a conception of what it is, yet it increasingly defies categorization. If we want to understand Facebook’s power in contemporary society and culture, Bucher argues, we need to start by challenging our widespread conception of what Facebook is. Tracing the development and evolution of Facebook as a social networking site, platform, infrastructure and advertising company, she invites readers to consider Facebook anew. Contrary to the belief that nobody uses Facebook anymore, Facebook has never been more powerful. is an Associate Professor in screen cultures in the Department of Media and Communication at the University of Oslo.

Title: CAMRI Research Seminar: Benedetta Brevini  Is AI Good for the Planet? | University of Westminster
Info: We often think of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a thing of the immediate future. We are constantly bombarded by slogans of AI coming to change our life, whether we like it or not. We are reassured it will be a better life. A better capitalism. A better environment. From smart devices to home voice assistants, image recognition and translation, AI is offered as the solution to the greatest challenges of this age. This portrayal of AI as a benevolent deity has a crucial effect: it obfuscates the materiality of the infrastructures and devices that are central to its functioning. In her new book Is AI good for the planet? (Polity, 2021). Benedetta Brevini asks us to think about AI in a different, and more material way than most of us have in the past. In all its variety of forms, AI relies on large swathes of land and sea, vast arrays of technology, and greenhouse gas-emitting machines and infrastructures that deplete scarce resources in their production, consumption and disposal. AI also relies on data centres that demand excessive amounts of energy, water and finite resources to compute, analyse and categorize. Firmly situated in the critical tradition of the political economy of communication, Brevini’s work forces us to reconsider the way we look at AI. For the first time, Is AI good for the planet? brings the climate crisis to the centre of debates around AI developments. Clearly, there are other important concerns about AI: from moral and ethical appeals for caution concerning use of AI in military operations to loss of human expertise in safeguarding human rights (public health and the judiciary), from algorithmic racial and gender biases to fears that AI will make human labour redundant. However, Brevini argues, if we lose our environment, we lose our planet. So, we must understand and debate the environmental costs of AI. is a journalist, media activist and Associate Professor of Communication at the University of Sydney.

Title: Panel discussion: Transition and the Legacy of Fossil Fuels - Materialities, Securitisation and Risks | University of Westminster
Info: This event is organised by Climate Change, Energy Policy and Sustainability Research Group at the University of Westminster. Prof Roland Dannreuther will address the implications of the transition to renewable energy and the shift away from global dependence on fossil fuels for International Relations. The theoretical focus will be on the materialities of fossil fuels; how different fossil fuels (oil, gas, and coal) have had historically differing international political and economic impacts; and what the legacies and the social, economic, and political implications of this history of dependence are with the shift to an energy transition. In her presentation, Dr Aurora Ganz will analyse the implications of energy securitisation that resulted from incorporating energy security into national security priorities. Ganz will discuss how securitisation downgrades alternative energy concerns – for example, access, availability and affordability of electricity, environmental and infrastructure degradation, or energy sustainability – and makes invisible the violence connected to securitisation practices. In the final intervention Dr Mathieu Blondeel will review the transition risks that International Oil Companies (IOCs) are faced with in the context of global energy systems transformation, and what sort of strategies IOCs are formulating in response to those challenges. In this context Blondeel will introduce ‘Transition Strategy Continuum’ in order capture the divergence and variety in strategic responses of IOCs. is Professor of International Relations at the University of Westminster.

Url: https://www.westminster.ac.uk/events/panel-discussion-international-climate-change-governance-and-the-question-of-scale
Title: Panel discussion: International Climate Change Governance and the Question of Scale | University of Westminster
Info: In the context of COP26, the panellists will explore the question of how to establish an appropriate balance between different scales of governance in achieving international GHG emissions reduction targets, whilst also promoting climate change adaptation. Climate change is widely viewed as a profound example of market failure. To address this, the majority of experts agree on the need for a strong global agreement on future emissions reductions to be confirmed on an urgent basis. However, recent years have seen significant debate about how far we should be relying on such a global agreement, with some emphasising that decentralised processes of change offer a more robust approach. For example, some contributions from the late Elinor Ostrom (2010), along with subsequent contributions from classical liberal political economists, question the effectiveness and indeed the desirability of the international climate change governance framework, emphasising instead the efficacy of decentralised forms of governance (Pennington, 2017). Related lines of argument emphasise the potential for market-driven approaches that enable climate change adaptation (Kahn et al., 2021). This prompts further questions about how global climate change governance can foster a suitable balance between the priorities of mitigation and adaptation. These debates highlight the need for further reflections on the findings of empirically orientated research in recent years across different fields which inform debates about the most effective balance between scales of climate change governance. This panel aims to provide such reflections, whilst also exploring potential future related research agendas.

Title: Centre for the Study of Democracy Autumn 2021 Seminar Series | University of Westminster
Info: We are excited to announce the speakers for the Centre for the Study of Democracy Autumn 2021 Seminar Series. All are welcome, but registration is required. Tuesday 12 October 2021, 4-5.30pm The protests which swept the Arab region as of 2011 strikingly singled out the leaders’ wives as the target of wrath. This paper argues that wives are key actors dually stabilizing and de-stabilizing their husbands as authoritarian leaders. By de-gendering the relational connection between the leader and his wife, the leader’s wife is repositioned in the paper as a more autonomous partner or holder of the joint account of authoritarianism, alongside the authoritarian husband. In contrast to much of the literature on authoritarianism, which is arguably mostly focused on structural, collective and externalized elements, this paper – and the larger project of which it is part – seeks to explore roles, identities and powers of the first ladies in a more systematic manner, through the mixed use of quantitative and qualitative analysis. Dr Mustafa Elmenshawy is a Post Doctoral Researcher at Lancaster University. He holds a PhD in politics from the University of Westminster and an MA in Middle East Politics from the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). His main research interests concern the interplay between discourse and politics in the Middle East. His latest publication is Sovereignty alignment process: strategies of regime survival in Egypt, Libya and Syria’, which was published in Third World Quarterly earlier this year. Tuesday 26 October 2021, 4-5.30pm In this talk Finn will discuss experiences of researching AFAB (assigned female at birth) transgender, transmasc, non-binary, gender non-conforming, butch, stud, and masculine-of-centre masculine identities and borders for the newly published book Female Masculinities and the Gender Wars. The talk will also reflect on the challenges of writing about this subject at a time of burgeoning sex and gender conservatism, when the LGBTQI+ community is under attack from a variety of forces across political spectrums. Finn Mackay is a Senior Lecturer in Sociology at the University of the West of England. Finn has published widely in the areas of feminist theory and activism, gender identity and borders with the LGBTQI+ community and is the author of Radical Feminism: Feminist Activism in Movement (Palgrave, 2015) and Female Masculinities and the Gender Wars: The Politics of Sex (Bloomsbury, 2021). Tuesday 9 November 2021, 4-5.30pm What comes after neoliberalism? Looking back to the role of the state in Plato, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Hegel, Gramsci and Polanyi, in The Great Recoil (Verso, 2021), Paolo Gerbaudo fleshes out the contours of the different statisms and populisms that inform contemporary politics. Neoliberalism, the ideology that presided over decades of market globalisation, is on trial, while state intervention is making a spectacular comeback amid lockdowns, mass vaccination programmes, deficit spending and climate planning. The central issue in dispute is what mission the post-pandemic state should pursue: whether it should protect native workers from immigration and the rich against redistributive demands, as proposed by the right’s authoritarian protectionism; or reassert social security and popular sovereignty against the rapacity of financial and tech elites, as advocated by the left’s social protectivism. Gerbaudo argues that it is only by addressing the widespread sense of exposure and vulnerability that socialists may turn the present phase of involution into an opportunity for social transformation. Dr Paolo Gerbaudo is Reader in Digital Culture and Society and the Director of the Centre for Digital Culture at King’s College London. His work focuses on the transformation of politics in the digital era. He is the author of a number of books, amongst which Tweets and the Streets (Pluto Press, 2012), The Mask and the Flag (Hurst & Company, 2017) and, most recently, The Digital Party (Pluto Press, 2018). Tuesday 23 November 2021, 4-5.30pm Francis Pakes will discuss the unique nature of prisons in Iceland, which are small, calm, and often set in remote, perhaps even idyllic, settings. What is it like to serve time there? And what is it like for foreign national prisoners, for whom, imprisonment is often particularly difficult. How do foreign national prisoners adapt to imprisonment on the edge of Europe? This talk will utilise photographs, stories, interview data and observations to come an understanding of the nature of prisons in Iceland and the specific challenges and adaptations that foreign national prisoners face. Francis Pakes is Professor of Criminology at the University of Portsmouth, UK. He is an expert on Nordic prisons and has spent time in the role of 'quasi prisoner' in Iceland's two open prisons. He has extensively written on prisons in Iceland, Norway and his native the Netherlands. His book, Comparative Criminal Justice, is in its fourth edition. Tuesday 7 December 2021, 4-5.30pm

Title: Online seminar: Urban form and human health | University of Westminster
Info: The COVID-19 virus has caused a worldwide pandemic that is spreading at an alarming rate. At present, COVID-19 has been linked to approximately 7.66 million cases and over 136,000 deaths in the United Kingdom. Several risk factors including age, gender, ethnicity, body mass index and pre-existing conditions have been suggested to play a role in exhibiting a more severe course of the disease. Reviews of pandemics with a similar magnitude indicate that the physical configuration of the built environment can also play a significant role in supporting human health and subsequently impacting the severity of disease. A critically important objective is to identify the major modifiable variables that may contribute to poorer COVID-19 health outcomes. In collaboration with colleagues from the School of Architecture and Cities, Life Sciences, and Social Sciences, we will present novel findings connecting aspects of urban form and air pollution, previously linked to exacerbating vitamin D deficiency, with COVID-19 prevalence and mortality across London. Our study sheds novel light on the combined impact of the built environment and air quality on vitamin D synthesis, a modifiable physiological process of increasingly acknowledged relevance for resilience against pathogens and long-term health and well-being.

Title: Falling Away - Symposium | University of Westminster
Info: The symposium will bring together researchers and practitioners from a diverse range of disciplines to discuss the agency of falling in contemporary culture. Metaphors of falling are often evoked to describe the current period of insecurity and instability. At the same time, the built environment reflects and in turns reproduces this state of suspension: while high-rise construction reshapes the landscapes of cities around the world, including London, its impact on our perception of gravity is yet to be understood. Typically defined as ‘the force that makes objects fall toward the earth’, gravity is so pervasive that we may overlook the multiple ways in which we rely on, and resist, it on a daily basis. How do creative practices engage with the perception of gravity, balance and falling? Can they mediate our fears and desires to lose the ground? What links can be drawn between the vertiginous spaces of our cities and the conditions of social instability in which we live? These and other related issues will be addressed from a variety of perspectives drawing on art, architecture, design, geography, psychology, and dance. Structured around a series of conversations, the symposium will conclude with a panel discussion with the artist Catherine Yass. The event is organised in conjunction with Falling Away, a major exhibition of Catherine Yass’s work in Ambika P3. Curated by Davide Deriu and Michael Mazière, the exhibition comprises seven vertiginous films of modern architectural structures that embody the institutions which built them. Spanning the past two decades, it is the first retrospective of the artist’s extensive body of film work in the UK. The joint events are aligned with the Vertigo in the City project based at the School of Architecture + Cities, University of Westminster. A full programme for the seminar will be made available shortly.

Title: Practicing Sustainability: from Portfolio to Practitioner | University of Westminster
Info: How do you take the ideas and commitment of your student portfolio into architectural practice? How can you build a career that reinforces your ideals and aims, rather than compromises them? These two talks, by architects at very different stages of their careers, will illustrate ‘how they do sustainable practice’, and the challenges and success they have had in addressing the concerns they had as students through their built projects. This session is organised by Professor Harry Charrington. Chris Morgan graduated from Newcastle University in 1991 with a project based on the use of woodland thinnings from Kielder Forest which he prototyped full-size. He has practiced for over 25-years in Glasgow, designing for climate justice through innovative and expert regeneration strategies, newbuild, conservation and retrofit design work.

Title: Sharing Untold Stories of Postcolonial Journeys | University of Westminster
Info: As part of Black History Year you are invited to a to contribute to decolonising the University of Westminster Curriculum. Moving away from traditional modes of imparting knowledge through hierarchical orders, the workshop provides a space for equal knowledge co-creation, where all participants and their stories are assembled together, as we all have arrived from somewhere and have a story to tell. We will spend the workshop making visible the hidden stories of our ancestors’ journeys and how they have been shaped by colonialism. This workshop practices what Sam Okoth Opondo calls “ ”, as a decolonising approach to mediating estrangement.  In the workshop we will act as amateur diplomats, sharing the censored genres of postcolonial experience. Using an experimental pedagogy our workshop will collate the usually untold stories – the colonial debris into a shared archive. We invite participants from all backgrounds to share family stories of place and (dis)placement, travel and arrival, escape and refuge, dispossession and resettlement to forge new forms of relationality. For the workshop, all participants must prepare the following: The workshop performs a feminist ethic of prioritising those stories that remain hidden from the public view, and it adopts a queer understanding of family as diverse and ever-changing relations.   Your stories will be shared with other family stories and therefore we ask you to reveal the moments that you are comfortable bringing into the public sphere.  We look forward to creating this collective archive with you. .

Title: Tibet, China and the Environmental Crises in Asia | University of Westminster
Info: A panel discussion with Tibetan environmentalists on the environmental crisis in Asia and the role of Tibet and China. The Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD), within the School of Social Sciences, has researched themes focusing on post-colonial politics, development and emerging powers. There is an explicit focus on engagement with communities and impacting upon public debates around contentious themes. The climate crisis is an area of major concern for us, and it becomes pertinent to focus on one of the largest industrial countries in the world – China and study the implications of their actions, focusing specifically on Tibet and generally on Asia. Tibet is the world’s highest plateau with many glaciers that act as the originating point for large rivers in Asia. Additionally, the region has a fragile ecosystem that needs to be preserved and best knowledge of how to do this lies with the indigenous community – Tibetans. However, under the Chinese state, Tibetans are oppressed, their knowledges dismissed with little to no say over their natural resources which are being aggressively exploited for China’s narrative of development and progress. This panel brings Tibetan environmentalists in conversation to shed light on the escalating climate crisis in Asia and the centrality of the Tibetan region in this. This is also a rare opportunity for students, scholars and guests to interact with Tibetan attendees of the COP26 UN Climate Summit happening in Glasgow and learn about the climate crisis from a non-European perspective, and be exposed to challenges facing indigenous communities in Asia. The panel will be chaired by Professor Dibyesh Anand, Head of School of Social Sciences, and will be followed by a Q &A round with the audience. Ms. Lobsang Yangtso was born in Tibet and completed her Bachelors in English Literature and Masters in International Studies from Stella Maris College, Chennai. She joined the Jawaharlal Nehru University for M.Phil in Chinese Studies, Centre for East Asian Studies and completed her PhD and her thesis titled “China’s Environmental Security Policies in Tibet: Implications to India, 2001-2013” from the same department. Currently, she works as a Research and Campaign Assistant to International Tibet Network. Her research interests are climate change, China’s Tibet Policy, China’s environmental policies towards Tibet, China and Tibet relations. Tenzin Choekyi is Senior Researcher at Tibet Watch, where she monitors and researches human rights and policy changes inside Tibet. As a graduate of Environmental science and policy, she worked as Advocacy Associate for International Campaigns for Tibet in presenting her findings about the controversial nomination of a Tibetan area as UNESCO world heritage. She also works as a Tibetan-French interpreter. Dechen Palmo is a research fellow at the Environment and Development Desk of the Tibet Policy Institute, Dharamshala. She researches Tibet’s Trans-Boundary Rivers focusing mainly on the Mekong and the Brahmaputra rivers. Dechen also writes on the damming crisis and China’s strategic interests in the rivers. She pursued her Masters in International Studies from Stella Maris College, University of Madras, and M.Phil. in International Relations from the University of Madras. She has also submitted her Ph.D. thesis titled “China’s National Interests on Transboundary Water Resources: A Comparative Study of the Brahmaputra and the Mekong River”. She has also written and published widely on environmental issues in Tibet caused by the developmental projects of the Chinese government. Fyvie Hall, 309 Regent Street, London W1B 2HW

Title: Cartographies of the Monsoon | University of Westminster
Info: This exhibition shows a selection of the maps produced by Monsoon Assemblages, a research project in the School of Architecture and Cities at the University of Westminster funded by the European Research Council between 2016-2021. The project drew on the environmental humanities, the natural sciences and the spatial disciplines to develop an understanding of the entanglements of the monsoon in everyday life, politics and planning in Chennai, Delhi, Dhaka and Yangon, four of South Asia’s rapidly growing cities. The maps were mechanisms through which the project team constructed understandings of the materiality of the monsoon and the many mechanisms that drive it. On 18 October, there will be an opening night event from 6.30–7.30pm. Lindsay Bremner and John Cook of Monsoon Assemblages will discuss the maps with Tom Corby, Associate Dean of Research, Central St Martins.

Title: Falling Away - Exhibition | University of Westminster
Info: The exhibition 'Falling Away' brings together Catherine Yass’s vertiginous film installations at Ambika P3. The first retrospective of the artist’s extensive body of film work, it spans the past two decades and includes a new work made in response to the impact of COVID-19 and global warming. Ambika P3’s vast subterranean space will engage audiences in the disorientating effects of Yass’s films, which portray architecture in a state of construction, abandonment or demolition. By engaging with our perception of verticality, these works address the relationship between material structures and the powers and institutions that embody them. The exhibition provokes us to think about the conditions of social and psychological instability in which we currently live. It draws attention to the vital role of public services, whose fragility has been exposed by the ongoing pandemic. For example, one of Yass’s films documents a hospital undergoing demolition from the perspective of the dying building, revealing a beleaguered NHS; in another film, the BBC appears vulnerable as its visionary TV Centre is dismantled for real estate. The sensory impact of these works will be fully experienced when exhibited in Ambika P3. Since its inception, Ambika P3 has been developing innovative methods for forming a distinctly experimental art site, rather than a gallery or cinema. This exhibition will further question the multiple relationships between artist, image, space, and viewer, as well as the collaborative role of the curator as designer and co-producer. 'Falling Away' is co-curated by film-maker and Ambika P3 curator and , Reader in Architectural History & Theory at the University of Westminster. The exhibition is informed by Deriu’s research into vertigo in the city as well as Maziere’s interdisciplinary curatorial practice. It will be accompanied by a symposium, secondary school and community workshops. An exhibition catalogue, freely available in print and open access, comprises essays by art writers, historians and critics as well as by the curators. For more information go to the .

Title: Sarah Schulman, 'Let the Record Show: A Political History of ACT UP, New York', book reading and discussion | University of Westminster
Info: The Centre for the Study of Democracy and the University of Westminster's Q+ Network are delighted to host the world-renowned author, activist and playwright on Monday 22 November at 12–1.30pm at our Little Titchfield Campus. Schulman will be reading from and discussing her latest book ' ' (2020, Macmillan). Twenty years in the making, Let the Record Show is the most comprehensive political history ever assembled of ACT UP and American AIDS activism. Rejecting the whitening of AIDS history, and examining the movement's mistakes as well as victories, Let the Record Show is a revelatory exploration- and long-overdue reassessment- of the coalition’s inner workings, conflicts and achievements, and ultimate fracture. Schulman, one of the most revered queer writers and thinkers of her generation, explores the how and the why, examining, with her characteristic rigour and bite, how a group of desperate outcasts changed America forever, and in the process created a liveable future for generations of people across the world. The book demonstrates that "the history of Act Up is the history of a group… any kind of history of AIDS that focuses on the heroic individual is a distortion". (Sarah Schulman). The reading will be followed by a live Q&A and copies of the book will be available to purchase at the event, provided by Housmans. The event will be recorded and is part of a two-day event series 'Uprising: Let the Record Show' organized in collaboration with ACT UP London, sponsored by Q+ Network and the Centre for the Study of Democracy at the University of Westminster, The John Mordaunt Trust, Positively UK, IBase, 56 Dean Street, Catwalk for Power, ICEBREAKERS, LGBT+ Switchboard, Oxford Queer Intersections. The University's social distancing and masking guidelines will be in place. Please adhere to these during the event and (unless exempt) you are required to wear face coverings inside the building.

Title: Urban Climate walking tour | University of Westminster
Info: We invite you to join us for an Urban Climate Walking tour through the City of London led by Dr. Julie Futcher. As part of on-going research into understanding the relationship between built form, energy and climate and the role of critical urban infrastructure we invite you to join us for a Special Interest Group Urban Climate Walking tour through the City of London led by Dr. Julie Futcher. During the walk Julie will report her latest research findings, alongside discussing the role of built form in addressing the challenges of the climate and environmental emergencies and the net-zero carbon targets. The City of London Urban Climate Walk presents a unique view of the City through the role of urban form in creating distinct urban microclimates and offers a novel perspective on London’s dramatic and changing skyline. The theme that links the various stops along the way is energy, both in its natural expression (temperature, wind and sunshine) and those of building needs (cooling and heating loads) and how these are interdependently linked at the scale of the city street. Throughout the walk we experience the direct and dynamic influence of built form on the background climate, demonstrating the far-reaching effects of increasing urban density on passive resources i.e. daylight and ventilation, and in turn the influence of these effects on thermal comfort, health and wellbeing – key components of healthy climate resilient cities. The walk promotes conversation around the direct links between architecture, planning, climate, and infrastructure, whilst clarifying the spatial and temporal characteristics of the various urban climate effects, including the different types of urban heat islands, often misrepresented in much non-urban climate literature. This walking tour is aimed at members of the Sustainable Cities and the Urban Environment (SCUE) Research Community (both academic staff and PhD students) and there are a limited number of places (20). The walk provides a chance for us to meet in person and we would also like members to join so we can explore the possibility of SCUE creating a similar tour between the University Westminster’s central London campuses. Rendezvous location: The Martha Smith Memorial Water Fountain, 39 Finsbury Square, London, EC2A

Digital replicas of a physical asset – “Digital Twins”, a term that originated from NASA – can collect large amounts of data and be used to predict maintenance issues and potentially save lives. We then turn our attention to FinTech and Financial Inclusion where new technology has improved access to financial products and services for those on low incomes who were previously excluded. Finally, the session looks at the emerging area of decentralised finance (DeFi) as well as the underlying blockchain technology infrastructure. Will this new approach to finance, independent of central financial intermediaries, shake up the banking sector to the same degree as we have seen with cryptocurrencies? Our panel line-up includes: The format will see each speaker give a brief presentation after which the moderator will open the floor to questions from the live audience.

Info: A Themed Interactive Discussion Event (TIDE) on Faith and Climate Action, hosted by the University of Westminster’s Interfaith Advice team. You are invited to join a Themed Interactive Discussion Event (TIDE), hosted by the University of Westminster’s Interfaith Advice team, featuring a panel of speakers responding to the question: Participants will then be invited to explore this question in small groups, joined by a speaker in the role of cultivator, before returning to a plenary discussion to harvest the wisdom, insight and questions that are unearthed. This event is open to students and staff of all faiths and none, with limited spaces available to members of the public. In 2021 many have experienced emergence from a time of inner reflection into stark awareness of troubles beyond the pandemic, both societal and environmental. Whilst a sense of global shared experience has arisen in our collective journey through the portal of Covid-19, leaving behind old normalities, we remain aware that the impact of global disease and climate change is being experienced disproportionately, repeating colonial patterns of violence and the theft of resources. Recent reports illuminate the extent of climate-related anxiety experienced by younger generations in Britain. In other parts of the world, concerns and anticipations have been replaced by grief for what is already lost. The publication of the sixth report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the upcoming Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow bring us to the gaps; in our own understanding; between words and actions; and the gap in time, between our environment and collapse, which is narrowing. Some who feel called upon to increase awareness of the climate crisis find support and imperatives to do so within their faith or spiritual tradition, but disagreements over interpretations and methods arise within and between traditions. Please join us in the sharing of wisdom and insights into what works, and what doesn’t work, in raising awareness of the climate crisis within our faith and spiritual communities.

According to Clapham, notions about war continue to influence how we conceive rights and obligations in national and international law. Although war has been formally outlawed, states nevertheless continue to claim that they can wage necessary wars of self-defence, engage in lawful killings in war, imprison law-of-war detainees, and attack objects which are said to be part of a war-sustaining economy. Clapham argues that the abolition of war as a permitted institution for settling disputes should lead to the limitations of those belligerent rights that once accompanied states at war. These challenging findings will be discussed with the help of renowned experts on the law of armed conflict.

Title: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy 10 year anniversary screening and live Q&A at Regent Street Cinema | University of Westminster
Info: Celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy with a special screening of the film, followed by a live Q&A featuring the director, Tomas Alfredson, screenwriter Peter Straughan, producer Robyn Slovo and John le Carré's son and a producer in his own right, Simon Cornwell. Set in the 1970s, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy finds George Smiley (Gary Oldman), a recently retired MI6 agent, doing his best to adjust to a life outside the secret service. However, when a disgraced agent reappears with information concerning a mole at the heart of the Circus, Smiley is drawn back into the murky field of espionage. Tasked with investigating which of his trusted former colleagues has chosen to betray him and their country, Smiley narrows his search to four suspects - all experienced, urbane, successful agents - but past histories, rivalries and friendships make it far from easy to pinpoint the man who is eating away at the heart of the British establishment. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy also stars Kathy Burke, Benedict Cumberbatch, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, Ciarán Hinds, John Hurt, Toby Jones, Konstantin Khabensky, Svetlana Khodchenkova, Roger Lloyd Pack, and Mark Strong.

Title: Contemporary China Centre Conference Deconstructed: Academia and China Threat Discourses | University of Westminster
Info: The first panel of the Contemporary China Centre (CCC) Conference Deconstructed series will be a panel discussion on 'China threat' discourses across academic disciplines in the UK, US and Australia. References to a perceived threat by China (what we call ‘China Threat Discourses”) and its implications for the global order loom large in discussions about the People’s Republic’s growing political, economic, and military influence. Whether in the context of “China’s rise” or “Wolf Warrior Diplomacy”, China’s global ascendancy is now regularly represented as malevolent and dangerous in European, North American, and Australian mass media, bearing an unsettling resemblance to longstanding Orientalist and Sinophobic practices. Often overlooked in this discourse, however, is the role of academics. As crucial actors in the formation and circulation of ideas and reference frames about China’s place in the world, what role does academia play in the formation and management of such discourses? The first panel of the Contemporary China Centre Conference Deconstructed, our new format for 2021/22, brings together leading international experts to discuss discursive constructions of the “China threat” across different academic disciplines. Based on their own research areas and experience, panellists will examine the ways in which “China threat” discourses work across their respective academic disciplines and will analyse the factors that have shaped their emergence and operation. They will consider the various implications of “China Threat” discourse and suggest ways in which it can be challenged without losing a critical stance towards both China and “the West”. The event is free to attend and open to all. A Zoom link will be provided to all those who before November 22. The Chair is from the University of Westminster.

Title: Decolonizing Democratic Innovations | University of Westminster
Info: Democratic innovations seek to reimagine democracy by deepening and amplifying the voices of ordinary people in the governance process. It is built on a deep-rooted conviction about the equality of all citizens and the role of democracy in promoting emancipation. And yet, like many institutions and practices in western liberal democracies, democratic innovations have yet to confront the history of colonialism, slavery, and white supremacy on which contemporary democratic states are built. Democracy itself – along with its ideals of freedom and equality – have, in many cases, been weaponized for war, invasion, and perpetuation of white domination. To what extent do democratic innovations – whether claimed or invited spaces – and the theoretical perspectives that inform these emerging institutions perpetuate these colonial dynamics. What would it mean to decolonize democratic innovations as a set of practices and as a field of academic study? This online public event will be led by scholars in the field of democratic theory and practice that have long called for a critical interrogation of democratic innovations’ emancipatory potential. It seeks to provoke reflection and critical dialogue among scholars of democratic innovations with a view to promoting collective learning and action. The event will be hosted by and speakers include: The public event is followed by a small face-to-face workshop in London, which reflect on: Places for the workshop are limited.

Title: Let the Record Show': Book Reading + Q&A with Sarah Schulman | University of Westminster
Info: Sarah Schulman reads selected excerpts from her latest book 'Let the Record Show: A Political History of ACT UP, New York' (2020, Macmillan). Twenty years in the making, Let the Record Show is the most comprehensive political history ever assembled of ACT UP and American AIDS activism. Rejecting the whitening of AIDS history, and examining the movements' mistakes as well as victories, Let the Record Show is a revelatory exploration- and long-overdue reassessment- of the coalition’s inner workings, conflicts and achievements, and ultimate fracture. Schulman, one of the most revered queer writers and thinkers of her generation, explores the how and the why, examining, with her characteristic rigor and bite, how a group of desperate outcasts changed America forever, and in the process created a liveable future for generations of people across the world. The book demonstrates that “the history of Act Up is the history of a group… any kind of history of Aids that focuses on the heroic individual is a distortion” (Sarah Schulman). The reading will be followed by a live Q&A.

Title: Workshop: learning to identify unhelpful thoughts using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy | University of Westminster
Info: It is very normal to have thoughts that are not always helpful. Often there is a pattern to such thoughts and we call these, "unhelpful thinking styles". When a person consistently and constantly uses some of these styles of thinking they can get stuck in vicious cycles of behaviours and often cause themselves a great deal of emotional distress.  It is worth taking a step back to observe our thoughts and check if they may be unhelpful right now. In this interactive workshop, based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, an evidence-based treatment used widely in the NHS, learn how to identify and challenge common unhelpful thinking patterns. .

Title: Technical Studies Open Lecture: Doris Sung | University of Westminster
Info: Please join us for the latest event in our Technical Studies Open Lecture series. ‘… if we are to develop truly sustainable architecture, we don’t necessarily need more materials. We need smarter ones.’ - Doris Sung In her ‘Bloom’ project, architect and inventor Doris Sung created a large lightweight monocoque structure comprised of 414 hyperbolic paraboloid (hypar) shaped panels made from a bimetal lamination of two alloys of nickel, manganese and iron with different thermal expansion coefficients. Bloom is a wonderful exposition of the properties and potential of bimetals in the creation of new responsive building skins that can passively open and close to ventilate and shade the building. An animated film of the Bloom project shows how the surface is activated by sun and shade. Doris Sung has subsequently developed a whole series of innovative architectural applications using thermobimetal. Her initial research on self-shading, self-ventilating and self-assembling alongside contemporary fabrication technologies has expanded the physical potential of the material, for example in the twisting and folding of her Oculus prototype, and she has now patented systems that are being commercialised for wider application. Her InVert™ window-shading system incorporates small bimetal ‘petals’ within a double-glazed glass module, and as the temperature from the sun increases, the bimetal elements deform and block the sunlight and shade the building’s interior. As the sunlight moves and the temperature cools, the bimetal elements revert to their original shape and position. The resultant solar shading reduces heat gain, which in turn can reduce artificial cooling needs by 28–42%, 36 depending on the geographical location.

Title: Contemporary China Centre Conference Deconstructed: The Value of Chinese Cultural Studies | University of Westminster
Info: In a geopolitical context where expertise on China is largely dominated by political scientists providing media commentary on “China’s rise”, “China threat”, and an emerging new political order, what is the value of Chinese cultural studies? What insights can a cultural studies approach provide that is accessible and considered relevant where relevance is defined as having an impact on wider debates in society, influencing policy, and hence being considered worth funding? What analytical, pedagogical, and even political possibilities and interventions does cultural studies bring to the study of China? Who is willing to engage with it? Who can afford to engage with it? And what can we do to change the perception, held by many, of cultural studies as something elitist, niche, and possibly irrelevant? The second panel of the Contemporary China Centre Conference, Deconstructed, our new format for 2021/22, brings together leading international experts to discuss some of these questions from the perspective of their own work. Panellists will discuss the social, institutional, theoretical, and methodological values that inform their engagement with cultural studies and will consider the place, significance and implications of this approach for the broader field of Chinese studies. The event is free to attend and open to all. A Zoom link will be provided to all those who register via by 15 December. Sarah Dauncey is Professor of Chinese Society and Disability at the University of Nottingham. She has published widely on the ways in which disability and impairment have been understood in Chinese culture and society since 1949. Her recent book – Disability in Contemporary China: Citizenship, Identity and Culture – presents a new theory of para-citizenship which uses China as a case study to argue that ways of belonging for disabled people are dynamic processes that change across cultures and across time. Michel Hockx is professor of Chinese Literature in the Department of East Asian Languages and Cultures and director of the Liu Institute for Asia and Asian Studies at the University of Notre Dame.

Title: BUIRA History of Industrial Relations Study Group  The Equal Pay Act 50 Years On: How Labour Governments have dealt with equal pay | University of Westminster
Info: The Equal Pay Act (1970) has been with us for fifty years, though it has now been largely superseded by the Equality Act (2010). In this seminar, we analyse its origins and impact on industrial relations under the 1974-79 Labour governments. We then move on to investigate how the New Labour governments attempted to deal with the persistent gender pay gaps from 1997 onwards and draw lessons for the present day. For further details and to reserve a place, please e-mail Michael Gold ( ) or Linda Clarke ( ). We’ll send a Zoom link a few days before the seminar. During the 1970s, there was an intensification of women-led industrial disputes, particularly in the five-year implementation period following the passing of the Equal Pay Act (EPA) 1970. Through strikes, workplace occupations and demonstrations, women workers demanded equal pay, improved working conditions and union recognition, and resisted redundancy, factory closure and productivity agreements. Between 1972 and 1979 roughly 43% of women-led industrial disputes were for equal pay. The shortcomings of the EPA also galvanised campaigns against workplace gender discrimination, with women union activists extending their demands beyond equal pay to address access to education and training, childcare facilities, and maternity leave. Drawing on the conclusions of my monograph on women’s union activism in the British film and television industries and preliminary findings from my research on equal pay strikes for the AHRC-funded Gender Equalities at Work project, this paper will explore trade union responses to the EPA. In 2001, the manifesto for Labour's second term included a commitment to address the gender pay gap. The Women and Work Commission was established in 2004 to investigate causes of the gender pay gap and make recommendations, following the Warwick agreement which reflected frustration among trade unions and arguably the breakdown of voluntary pluralism which had characterised Labour's first term. Equal pay was a long- standing trade union demand and had also been adopted as Labour policy. However, although the gender pay gap narrowed slightly after 1997 it still stood at 19.2% by the end of Labour's term of office, and few policy interventions directly addressed it. This paper critically assesses how far Labour's dominant mode of employment policy regulation addressed the gender pay gap, and why. It revisits the 'classic' areas of voluntary pluralism in the early Labour period (national minimum wage, union recognition, and flexible working) and shows that policy on the gender pay gap suffered from uneven attention, as well as leaders' perceptions of cost and difficulty. ProBE (Centre for the Study of the Production of the Built Environment) is ideally placed to organise this symposium as a joint research centre between Westminster Business School (WBS) and the School of Architecture and the Built Environment (ABE), committed to the development of a rich programme of research and related activities, including projects, oral history, film, exhibitions, and seminars. ProBE provides a research hub, a forum for debate and discussion and a focus for interdisciplinary and international activity related to the production of the built environment, as a social process, and its members have long experience of research on VET in the construction industry in Britain and abroad.

Title: AHRA Research Student Symposium | University of Westminster
Info: The AHRA Research Student Symposium 2022, "Voices in Architecture", considers voices in architectural research, posing the critical questions: who speaks and for whom? How do we give voice without assuming authority? How do we listen without judgment? How do we adjust the volume of our own voices? Iman Keaik (PhD Candidate and Visiting Lecturer in the School of Architecture and Cities Voices in the urban fabric are the collection of concrete experience and encounters both planned and accidental and act as a product of collective opinion outlined by researchers around the most controversial topics in the city. Voices are the essence of the city’s fabric and during the two-day hybrid event organised by AHRA Research Student Symposium 2022, issues of subjectivity and objectivity of the researchers were tackled by also fine-tuning the research journey to consider not only the ‘singular space’ but rather engage with different voices. Voices can be channelled through heavy and loud noises in the city trying to shift attention to create a centre for debate. Other voices can rather be low whispers channelled through rough and invisible layers buried in the busy underground of the city. Tuning in to these different harmonious or unmelodic tunes is the instrumental role of the researcher to unpack critically different urban conditions. Listen rather than hear, address rather than acknowledge, propose rather than observe was the underlying common denominator between the 20 different research presentations in the two-day symposium that took place at the University of Westminster. Therefore, the remarkable purpose of the AHRA Research Student Symposium 2022 entitled "Voices in Architecture" was to pay attention to what resides at the margins of our sight and at the deep end of the fringes of noises in the urban environment. Addressing controversial issues around democracy and political positioning of the researcher, the presentation transported us on a journey between projects covering different global contexts and tackling sensitive issues around vernacular traditions, informal settlements, transient and temporary architectures among others. Each presentation gave a unique insight on how to address questions like who speaks and for whom? How do we give voice without assuming authority? How do we listen without judgment? How do we adjust the volume of our own voices? Importance of courage as a researcher was one of the redundant topics during the symposium. Using courage to disseminate the work especially when tackling sensitive issues such as investigating processes of public engagement and empowerment, social stratification, and elitism. The need to propagate and discuss the research with the wider community can attract criticism and might feel daunting for the researcher. However, formulating a solid argument and taking a stand to use the researcher’s own voice is as crucial as any other technical skill one can acquire. At its best, this symposium was opening up a stage for these 20 researchers to take a position and express other people’s voices through different mediums. Creativity in addressing the most sensitive issues was the most fascinating part of the symposium. Thus, it goes beyond the submission of papers by exposing us to different methods of representing the research, from audio archives, films, drawings, site visits, creative hybrid drawings, architecture propositions, puppet making, photography, fiction, love letters... Researchers touched on the importance of subjectivity of the researcher when crafting the conversation especially when the researcher is an insider voice. Insider and outsider voices were defined during the symposium to position the person in or outside the context indulging with the hidden stories of the city. Whilst the outsider researcher can find it harder to pick up on the hidden gems of the city, it can give a fresh and analytical perspective on the controversial issues. The role of the researcher’s voice was associated with a ‘nomadic mind’ where the perspective lies on asking fundamental questions that goes beyond the Why, How, Who… The intensive field works can have repercussion on the positioning of the researcher in the ethnographic research where it can move ‘from me and them to us’. The attachment of the researcher to the subject in a specific context drove endless discussion on the prejudice and subjectivity of the researcher. In addition, notion of ‘intersectionality’ was mentioned in a couple of presentations highlighting the importance of recognising the identity markers while interviewing or conducting any field work. The identity markers do not exist independently, and it inform the others which creates a field of opposing oppressions. Whilst each dimension of oppressions is developed through a network of interconnected identities, the ’micro moments in the city can have macro impacts’. The voice of the researcher is to unpack these layers of inequalities and oppressions by investigating the hidden ‘micro moments’ that feed in the ‘macro implications’ in order to create a consistent voice of its own without any authority assumptions. For example, statements like ‘I am not a female architect, I am an architect’ questions how and why history should be adjusted to accommodate the modern ideas of feminism in architecture (Appoline Vranken). Other researcher studied the importance of dust in shaping the identity and ecology of Maltese landscape by stating that ‘dust became a place of agency - its drift characteristic and ability to travel became a state of present in each stone wanting to become’ (Katrina Galea). Transported from dust to science fiction in architecture, novel becomes part of an imaginary story that articulate fears and thoughts of lived spaces. It strips away the spaces from power that are deep in the spaces we inhabit and thrive to ‘create democratic spaces to address the agency’ rather than live harmoniously with it (Amy Butts). Voices in architecture then becomes protagonists in novels seeking to escape the man-made environment to discover new ways of living. Adjusting the volume of key of the researcher voice is key to shed a light on the discrepancies and offer new possibilities to feed in the design process. The everyday contested spaces are too often lost in the shadow of the high rise of expectations and fears. This does injustice of the cities we inhabit and drive hope to depict new realms for the future we might hope for. Residing in the smaller domestic spaces we can give voices to others by accentuating the spaces of gathering and spaces that needs to be heard. On an end note, Kate Jordan and Maja Jovic concluded the symposium by shedding a light on the importance of actually listening not only to the ‘singular space’, but to also include the different voices in the city and the various views around controversial and sensitive topics. In turbulent space and as researcher we are at the core mission to open up to new possibilities and to place ourselves at the centre of debating the dichotomy. In my opinion, this symposium by its turn gave voice to researcher by opening up the room for open minded and enlightening discussions to highlight the most challenging, vulnerable, and invisible voices in the urban environment. To all the speakers, audience, and readers of this review, continue to push onwards and upwards by giving the voice to those who need it the most. Iman Keaik, May 2022 A key objective of the symposium will be to connect architectural research with wider political concerns around democracy, protest and populism and we are particularly attentive to processes of public engagement and empowerment, social stratification and elitism. The symposium also seeks to investigate diverse modes of production and their social worlds and is interested in submissions that explore vernacular traditions, informal settlements, transient and temporary architectures. The keynote lectures will be delivered by Professor Christine Wall (University of Westminster) and Alexandre Apsan Frediani (International Institute for Environment and Development). To further provide the early career researchers with an insight into ways of ‘using’ their research, besides paper presentations and discussions, the symposium will offer three sets of activities that participants can choose from. These activities will each include a visit to a site, followed by a workshop: All activities will be offered in a blended form and include physical visits with digital counterparts. Registration is via Eventbrite The organisers invite contributions that consider human-centred research methodologies both within and beyond the discrete boundaries of architecture, welcoming submissions from disciplines including literary theory, cultural studies, art history, anthropology, geography and planning. In line with this, we welcome paper presentations, as well as non-standard proposals (film, performance, photography, etc.). The research methods explored will include (but not be limited to) oral histories and interviews; ethnography; participative and interactive practices; social media and digital technologies, use of archives and material culture. We will explore the practical and ethical boundaries of such research, giving consideration to questions of privacy and to the politics of identity. We are interested in modes of dialogue: can we find ways of speaking ‘with’ as suggested by Ariella Azoulay in her recent work? Research that offers a platform to voices of otherness is particularly encouraged - the symposium is committed to the objectives of decolonisation in architectural history, theory and praxis, foregrounding narratives of gender, sexuality, race and non-conformity. Please send your abstracts, if the contribution is in standard paper presentation form, or proposals for other forms of contribution and participation by to . Other forms of participation (film, performance, photography, graphic work, etc.) should be discussed in advance with the Organising Chairs. Abstracts and proposals may be in Word, Notepad or PDF format with the following information: author(s), affiliation, e-mail address, title of proposal, type of proposal (ie. paper presentation, film, performance, etc.), body of proposal (300 words), up to 10 keywords, and biography (200 words).

Info: The Centre for the Study of Democracy and the Department of Politics and International Relations are organising a full programme of research seminars with visiting speakers this semester. Events will take place on Tuesdays 4-5.30pm, either online, or in the Westminster Forum, Level 5, 32-38 Wells street, University of Westminster, W1T 3UW. All are welcome to attend the seminars but registration is required. Please note that for in person events, places are limited and will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis. For online events, once you book your ticket, a link to the talk will be sent to you closer to the date. Tuesday 8 February, 3-5:30pm (online - note earlier start) This talk will offer some preliminary reflections on the transformations of democracy as a system of norms and institutions which regulate the exercise of power. The analysis of revolutionary and counterrevolutionary politics in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region sheds useful light on how models of democratic governance have been transforming, resonating transnationally. Building on the scholarship on regime types, democratic backsliding and centring the epistemological ruptures that the uprisings in the region have caused in the context of the debates among Area studies scholars, the goal of this paper is to highlight the important contribution that Area studies can make to disciplinary debates. Tuesday 22 February 2022, 4-5:30pm (in-person) This presentation develops a border abolitionist perspective to migration governmentality, with a specific focus on the confinement continuum that those racialised as “migrants” are subjected to. It starts by taking stock of the partially missed encounter between critical critical migration scholarship and carceral abolitionist literature. It shows that an abolitionist perspective enables tracing connections between interlocking forms of racialisation and, at the same time, building transversal alliances of solidarity. It moves on by challenging mechanisms of migration confinement beyond what Ruth Gilmore defined as “the politics of white innocence”. It concludes by interrogating what a critical knowledge of the border regime might mean in a context characterised by states’ blatant violations of the international law. Tuesday 8 March, 4-5:30pm (online) This paper investigates the incursions of the Indian state into what are often called its ‘northeast borderlands’. It uses Temsula Ao’s ethnographic, political, and literary work to complicate understandings of both ‘the border’ and ‘intervention’. Ao is one of the most prominent writers of contemporary Nagaland. Born when the Naga Hills were still administered by the British, Ao grew up when the Indian government drew ever more elaborate schemes to control and taxonomise the region, she has borne witness, in both her lived experienced and her scholarship, to the changing political landscape of the Naga Hills. Through a tarrying with Ao’s work, talk paper interrogates the multiple resonances of intervention – colonial, postcolonial, invasive, and cursory to explore the ways in which intervention is experienced, theorised and resisted in border regions. Tuesday 22 March, 4-5:30pm (in-person) Tuesday 5 April, 4-5:30pm (online) today. Global histories of racial hierarchy and violence have important implications for understanding the continued salience of race within Western polities.

Title: Global Race War: International Politics and Racial Hierarchy | University of Westminster
Info: In this recently published book, Alexander Barder of Florida International University shows how specific racial imaginaries have, over the past two centuries, cut across politically defined state boundaries to legitimate practices of genocidal violence against so-called "enemy races." Barder traces the emergence of this global racial hierarchy from the early 19th century to the present to explain how a historical racial global order unraveled over the first half of the 20th century, continued during the Cold War, and reemerged during the Global War on Terror. Imperial, racial, and geopolitical orders intersected over time in ways that violently tore apart the imperial and sovereign state system and continue to haunt politics today. Global histories of racial hierarchy and violence have important implications for understanding the continued salience of race within Western polities. Dr Alexander Barder is Assistant Professor of Politics and International Relations at Florida International University. Previously, he was Assistant Professor at the American University of Beirut. His main research focuses on historical and contemporary forms of international hierarchy, imperialism, and war.

Title: Workshop 1: The Challenges and Problems of Conducting Ethical Qualitative Research | University of Westminster
Info: We would like to invite you to the first workshop of the AHRC funded Network for Rethinking Research Ethics Frameworks and Processes in the Humanities on 21 April 2022 10-5pm. This is the Network’s first large workshop and we have chosen the title: The Challenges and Problems of Conducting Ethical Qualitative Research. The workshop will focus on the relationship between researchers, ethics committees and participants. We want to understand the challenges and problems that this relationship brings, how we might learn from them, and how we might address them. We will do this firstly by creating a ‘storytelling’ space where we invite you to share your encounters with ethics committees. Secondly, we invite panel presentations (10 minutes maximum) focusing on the most challenging areas regarding research ethics: informed consent, ethical committees, covert and hybrid research, anonymity and protecting participants, online research and post-field ethics. , please send an email to and by 28 February. If you wish to present in one of the panels, please provide us with a title and a brief 100 word summary of what you would like to talk about. The storytelling will be more ad hoc, with as many of you as possible invited to share your 5-10 minute story. For more details on sessions and timings, please see the workshop schedule below. When it comes to ethically challenging or ‘risky’ work, ethics committees often have difficulty understanding both research contexts and how proposed methods will work in practice. This often means that important work is restricted, and sometimes even prevented altogether. It is also often the case that postgraduate researchers (and their supervisors) and early career researchers are often left unable to navigate these processes due to a lack of clear guidance. The aim of this Network is to collaboratively produce some form of ‘toolkit’, aimed at research funding/governance bodies, universities and researchers, which will set out recommendations for supporting and managing ethically challenging research projects. The Network’s funding allows us to award a limited number of travel bursaries (up to £50 each) which are available to postgraduate researchers, early career academics and the unwaged. Please get in touch with Victoria and Geoff if you need one of these. Lunch and refreshments will be provided free of charge.

For example, leaders have the responsibility to tackle dysfunctional organisations and cultures. We will discuss signs of dysfunction such as lack of communication, resources and shared mission. What are the characteristics of toxic leaders? Why does toxic leadership happen and in what environments does it thrive? How does this contrast with ethical leadership? When faced with these issues, we may even ask ourselves whether we really need leaders at all. The panel will consider whether leaderless organisations are the future. Is self-management instinctive? Is it easier for the workforce to organise themselves in the post-covid digital world?

Title: Restoring the Values of Policing | University of Westminster
Info: What are the challenges of policing in a democratic country with a diverse population? What is, and what should be, the role of policing? Is the Metropolitan Police responsible for multicultural London facing a crisis? Over the last few years, confidence in the Metropolitan Police has decreased. High profile cases have negatively impacted the reputation of the MET. Assistant Commissioner Louisa Rolfe will discuss some of the strategies and campaigns that are now in place to restore public confidence. She will also talk about a career in the police for students considering joining the force and hold a Q&A session for questions relating to MET campaigns to build trust and recruit graduate students. If you are interested in knowing more about various initiatives taken by the Metropolitan Police to provide a better service to the diverse population of London, please join us. Louisa Rolfe (OBE) is the current Assistant Commissioner of MET Operations. AC Louisa began her career at Avon and Somerset Constabulary where, over 25 years, she rose from a neighbourhood police constable to become one of the country’s most senior officers. She joined West Midlands Police as deputy chief constable in February 2016, where she oversaw the force’s WMP2020 change programme, which featured 33 individual projects designed to make the force more agile when fighting crime and more accessible to the public. AC Louisa leads the force’s strategy on Violence against Women and Girls and their ‘Rebuilding Trust Initiative’.

Title: Contemporary China Centre Conference, Deconstructed: Connecting Chinese Digital and Analogue Spaces | University of Westminster
Info: Digital technologies have radically altered how people across the globe live, work, connect with others, and access information. This is particularly true for the People’s Republic of China, the country with the largest internet population in the world and one that is also at the forefront of digital innovation. Whether it’s ‘smart cities’, e-commerce, wanghong or even data collection and state surveillance, digital technologies have variously enabled, expanded or even compressed the possibilities for analogue community, activism and political engagement in China today. This event, the third in the CCC Conferences Deconstructed, brings together leading international experts to discuss the dynamic dialectal relationship between the digital and the analogue in contemporary China. Based on their own research areas and case studies from across the field of literature, politics, and human geography, panellists will examine how digital events and debates engage with, reflect and inform the “real world”, and vice versa. The event is open to all. A Zoom link will be provided to all those who register on before March 8th. Heather Inwood is Associate Professor of modern Chinese literature and culture at the University of Cambridge, and a Fellow of Trinity Hall. Her research focuses on interactions between literature, popular culture and digital media in contemporary China. She is the author of Verse Going Viral: China’s New Media Scenes, and is currently writing a book on Chinese internet fiction. Carwyn Morris is a postdoctoral researcher at the Manchester China Institute. A human geographer, he examines mobility and stillness across digital and physical geographies, particularly China's geographies, and considers the relationship between territory, borders and informality across digital and physical spaces. He occasionally collaborates on zines, such as Pomelo, which reflects on the 1930s Chinese women's magazine, Linglong. Oscar Tianyang Zhou is a lecturer in media studies at the School of Humanities, University of Hertfordshire (UK). He is interested in digital cultures and communications in a transnational context, including but not limited to media and technology in everyday life, queer digital cultures and activism, critical big data and algorithm studies, Chinese media and politics, as well as feminist media studies.

Here at her table are the influences of Africa, India, Spain, France and Portugal. We are offered painless lessons in healthful eating and are asked only to bring open minds and expectant palates. I like this kind of writing and I like this kind of invitation. I accept."

Title: How the French Made London Home and Other London French Stories | University of Westminster
Info: HOMELandS (Hub On Migration, Exile, Languages and Spaces) and the School of Humanities, University of Westminster, warmly invite you to a Book Launch Duet at 5pm, Thursday 10 March 2022 in Fyvie Hall, University of Westminster, 309 Regent Street, London W1B 2HW. Through a reworking of Bourdieusian thought, the book provides a window onto the everyday lived experience of a diverse set of French migrants who have chosen to make London home. From schooling and healthcare to eating and drinking, their evolving behaviours, attitudes, identities and belongings are rigorously scrutinised in both physical and digital spaces, as are the implicit reasons underpinning their mobility and settlement. A timely epilogue offers rare insights into the affective dimensions of “Brexit” and its “unsettling” impact. British references to France and the French are littered with clichéd references to food, but the place of the French restaurant in London’s food culture is more nuanced. This is the story of what happens when an essentially Parisian institution establishes itself in its neighbour’s capital city and of the people who produce, purvey, purchase and consume French food culture in London over a period of some 150 years. An afterword considers the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the restaurant trade in London and how French restaurants responded. In addition to the authors, we are delighted to welcome Dr Charlotte Faucher, Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow at the Université Paris 3 Sorbonne Nouvelle, and Dr Ruth Cruickshank, Reader in French and Comparative Literature and Culture at Royal Holloway, University of London, to share their respective readings of French London and Fishes with Funny French Names. Do join us for drinks and nibbles at the informal celebration of these two books. This may appear to be a work-related meeting, but it is in fact a party. The University of Westminster has introduced a range of measures to ensure your safety and wellbeing whilst attending events on campus. This currently includes the requirement for face-coverings to be worn when indoors (unless you have an exemption), directional markings, hand-sanitisation points, and safety screens.

Title: Building an Anti-Racist University: easier said than done, but not impossible | University of Westminster
Info: Westminster Conversations invites colleagues, students and guests to attend a talk with Dr Gurnam Singh. Though demands for anti-racism are not new, the experience of COVID 19, and the Murder of George Floyd in May 2020, which sparked protests around the world, brought issues of systemic and structural racism and the ongoing violence’s of coloniality to the fore across many fields and sectors, and higher education is no exception. For racially minoritized students, as well the experience of direct racism and microaggressions, structural racism is clearly evidenced in data on racial disparities reassociated with admissions, progression, academic ‘dishonesty’ disciplinary mechanisms, degree awarding and graduate outcomes. For non-white staff, obstacles in recruitment, selection, and progression, and being subjected to disproportionate levels of surveillance, are commonly reported. Combining a range of theoretical orientations drawn from black and post/anti-colonial studies, critical/radical pedagogy and complexity theory, this presentation will seek to uncover the nature of the problem of racism in higher education and the possibility of designing anti-racist interventions that are able to disrupt and ultimately eradicate racism. Dr Gurnam Singh is an activist researcher, writer, and educator. His work is dedicated to highlighting and disrupting systems and mechanisms of power, privilege and violence that lead to human suffering and inequity. Presently, he has a fractional post as Associate Professor of Education Attainment at Coventry University. He also holds several visiting posts: Associate Professor of Sociology, University of Warwick; Professor of Social Work, University of Chester; and Fellow in Race and Education, University of Arts, London. He grew up in an inner-city poor working-class multi-ethnic community and his struggles against poverty, exclusion, racism, and state violence have shaped his approach to life and learning. In 2005 was awarded a Doctorate in Sociology from the University of Warwick, in 2009, in 2009 he was awarded a National Teaching Fellowship (NTF), and in 2018 Dr Singh was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of the Arts (FRSA). Dr Singh has published 4 books and 40 book chapters and peer-review journal articles and numerous monographs, research reports, conference papers, blogs, and newspaper articles on a wide range of issues related to social justice, anti-racism.

Title: Languages and Permacultural Justice: Decoloniality and Multilingualism - Professor Alison Phipps | University of Westminster
Info: We are delighted to invite you to the Westminster Forum for Language and Linguistics Annual Lecture 2022. of the University of Glasgow, who has been spearheading debates about decolonising the study of multilingualism, has kindly agreed to come and talk about this. Her lecture, entitled Languages and Permacultural Justice: Decoloniality and Multilingualism will take place in Fyvie Hall on 7 April at 5pm and will be followed by a reception in the foyer of our Regent Street building. It promises to be a fascinating and thought-provoking event. “Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.” Much of the struggle against language death, or linguacide or language attrition is researched and studied under rubrics of counting and auditing the extent of the loss of diversity and economic benefits, or through the appeal to language rights. In this respect the considerable endeavours of scholarship, which have also been critiqued for the varieties of metaphors deployed – from kinship to ecology and beyond – remains within at best what Pureza (2005) refers to as the two ages of the common heritage of humankind. In this talk I will consider the possibility of a third age which might see the intangible and tangible common cultural heritage of humankind as amenable to the framings and exemplars offered by the concept of cultural justice. Resting on the normative directions offered by Article 27, and the critical engagement of indigenous and migrant-led scholarship with its relatedness to land, earth, lore and language, and the more than human world, I will offer some tentative suggestions as who we might consider safeguarding epistemic and ontological linguistic heritage for moving towards a third age of common heritage of humankind. Starting from painful experiences taken from the decoloniality of those subject to linguicide and epistemicide this lecture will begin to elaborate regenerative and restorative ways of enabling both thinking about and through multilingualism to enable people to begin to exercise their Article 27 rights, in scholarship, in scientific endeavour, in the arts and in cultural life. Expect poetry, proverbs, music, interruptions and some prose. .

Url: https://www.westminster.ac.uk/events/changing-discourses-of-reproduction-in-the-peoples-republic-of-china
Title: Changing Discourses of Reproduction in the Peoples Republic of China | University of Westminster
Info: Last year, the Chinese government announced that married couples across the country would now be allowed to have up to three children, marking a dramatic reversal of the one-child policy, which was first enacted in 1979 to limit Chinese couples to one child each through a range of incentives and punishments. Months later, as part of further efforts to encourage couples to have more children to counter falling birth rates and aging population, the government declared that it would seek to reduce abortions for “non-medical purposes”. However, at the same time, births in Xinjiang have reportedly plummeted amidst the ongoing crackdown on the Uyghurs and other minority groups in the region. What do these various shifts in rhetoric and policy mean for how we understand questions of reproductive (in)justice and gender (in)equality in contemporary China? Who is most affected, how and why? What forms of support, resistance and/or negotiation have emerged in response to these changes? And what might we learn by placing these trends within a broader historical and global context? The fourth panel of the Contemporary China Centre Conference, Deconstructed, our new format for 2021/22, brings together leading international experts to discuss the changing discourses and practices of reproduction in contemporary China. Based on their own research areas and case studies, panellists will examine questions of reproductive control, healthcare, technologies, education, activism, and the right to parent. This event will also introduce a new collection of Chinese propaganda posters about the one-child policy and birth control methods, soon to be available at the University of Westminster Archive. The event is free to attend and open to all. A Zoom link will be provided to all those who by 12 April. Sarah Mellors Rodriguez is assistant professor of East Asian history at Missouri State University. Her forthcoming book, Reproductive Realities in China: Birth Control and Abortion, 1911-2021 (Cambridge University Press, 2022), uses interviews and archival research to analyse how ordinary people, particularly women, navigated China’s shifting fertility policies both before and during the one-child policy era. Kailing Xie is lecturer in International Development at the University of Birmingham. Her work investigates the underlying social, cultural and political tensions underpinning China's economic success through the lens of gender. Kailing's book Embodying Middle Class Gender Aspirations: Perspectives from China's Privileged Young Women (Palgrave Macmillan, 2021) throws light on how gender affects the lives of well-educated urban Chinese women born in the 1980s. This book examines gendered attitudes in China to marriage, reproductive choices, career choices, and aspirations for a good life.

Title: Research Symposium: Rethinking Trust, Harm and Consent in a Digital Age - open call for papers | University of Westminster
Info: University of Westminster, Regent Street, Room UG05 Today, we live out a large proportion of our lives online. Much of this activity is conducted on mobile digital devices, which are seamlessly integrated into our personal and professional lives. This has allowed for the development of surveillance methods that enable governments and private actors – to peer into the most intimate aspects of peoples’ existences. The digitalisation of everyday life has also made possible the objectifying, dehumanising and decontextualizing of human engagement and identity into measurable and quantifiable data units. The insidious and unequal effects of these digital technologies across different populations has reconfigured ideas of trust, harm and consent in liberal democracies. This symposium is designed to bring together researchers working on issues around technology, surveillance and control, from across disciplines to explore questions around the transformation of trust, harm and consent in democratic states. The aim is to think transversally about questions of technology and digital surveillance, outside of the confines of disciplinary camps or narrow research ‘objects’ to draw broader conclusions and open up new lines of enquiry for future research collaborations. We invite expressions of interest, comprised of name, institution/department and a short (250 word) abstract from prospective participants. Indicative themes include, but are not limited to: Please send the expression of interest to Lea Sitkin ( ) and Emma McCluskey ( ) by Friday 8 April 2022.

Title: Book Launch: China and the West or China vs the West? Differences over Ukraine War and other Issues | University of Westminster
Info: Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD), along with Bite-Sized Publishers, invites you to a discussion on contested relations between China and the West. The discussion is centred around Yue Parkinson’s books including China Vs the West (2021) and the launch of a new one The Misunderstanding between China and the West - Why doesn't China Stand by the US in the Ukraine War. The Ukraine War is changing the balance of Europe and at the same time raising further questions about the approaches of the non-Western powers, especially China. Various commentators have raised the prospect of a new Cold War with China and Russia on one side and the US-led West on the other. That such commentaries ignore the majority of the states in the world does not undermine their power to shape the global agenda in the coming days. Has the Russia-Ukraine war underlined the already existing fissures between China and the West or is it creating new ones? The event will focus on some of the different ways in which China and the West can, and do, relate to each other. Yue He Parkinson, is a with Financial Times and a bilingual author. She writes in English about China, and in Chinese about the West, with the benefit of two mindsets combining Chinese and Western empathy and know-how. She is the first and only Chinese writer who has been persistently writing in her Chinese articles that the UK has transformed itself into a far more egalitarian country than the widely held Chinese perception of the UK’s class-based society. She is the author of China and the West: Unravelling 100 Years of Misunderstanding published in 2021. Her second volume The Misunderstanding between China and the West - Why doesn't China Stand by the US in the Ukraine War, will be published in May 2022. Yue has translated food guru Ken Hom’s autobiography into Chinese. Her Chinese book on Brexit planned to be published in May 2020, was suspended due to the turbulent relationship between China and Britain. Vince Cable is the former leader of the Liberal Democrat party 2017-19. He was Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills for five years. Vince is currently a professor in Practice at the LSE, visiting Professor at Nottingham University, and visiting professor at St Mary University. Ken Hom OBE is a leading authority on Chinese cuisine, one of the most respected and celebrated TV chefs of all time, the author of almost 40 books, which have inspired millions of home cooks around the world. He has presented seven UK television series launching his career over 35 years ago with Ken Hom’s Chinese Cookery. His most recent book is his autobiography ‘My Stir Fried Life’ – published in English, Chinese and soon in Thai, and available from Amazon. He is a founding patron of the Oxford Cultural Collective, also an ambassador for GREAT, the UK Government’s international marketing campaign. Professor Dibyesh Anand is the Head of the School of Social Sciences at the University of Westminster, London and a professor of international relations.

Title: Pride: Protest or Celebration? | University of Westminster
Info: Virtual panel discussion organized by Q+ Network (University of Westminster) for LGBTQ+ Pride Month. In June 1972, thousands of LGBTQ+ people took the streets in Hyde Park to demand their civil rights in London’s first Pride march. Now, 50 years on, Pride has not only become increasingly visible but has also transformed tremendously. Pride is becoming part of the landscape in various countries, often marked by contestation and precarity. This virtual panel discussion hosted by Q+ Network at the University of Westminster will reflect on the politics of Pride between celebration and protest. Has Pride become a tool of domestication? How does queer liberation fit within contemporary Pride events? How do we as a queer community engage with the commercialisation of our identities, the corporate sponsorship of Pride parades and very visible efforts to incorporate LGBTQ rights for homonationalist purposes?

Title: Westminster Business School Debates | Should I Aspire to be a Good Leader or a Good Manager? | University of Westminster
Info: The Westminster Business School Debates concept seeks to bring together an interdisciplinary panel of speakers who bring a variety of perspectives to make for a stimulating and insightful debate around the topic under discussion. The latest in our series of debates will explore what it really means to be a leader or manager. The distinction is often glossed over with the terms “management” and “leadership” even used interchangeably in some contexts. How then can we better define the terms and distinguish between what makes a good manager and a good leader? Managers are usually more clearly identified within organisational structures. How can we identify someone as a leader rather than a manager? Do you have to work your way up through different levels of management before you can become a leader? We will also consider the role of followers. Are all employees followers? Our speakers for the event are as follows:

Title: Remembering Bhutan: A Conversation with Dasho Karma Ura | University of Westminster
Info: The Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD), within the School of Social Sciences, University of Westminster, has research themes focusing on democracies, post-colonial politics, development and emerging powers. There is an explicit focus on engagement with communities and places that are relatively ignored in mainstream politics and international relations. Bhutan is one such place. Despite being a pioneer in innovative forms of governance, climate policy, sustainability, and politics, including the widely known concept of Gross National Happiness (GNH), little attention is given to Bhutan in the academic and public sphere. Dr Nitasha Kaul's work within CSD has been crucial in challenging this neglect of Bhutan with her extensive range of research, presentations and publications on the history, politics and geopolitics of Bhutan as a small Himalayan state. This public event brings together Dasho Karma Ura, one of Bhutan's foremost intellectuals, in conversation with Dr Kaul. Dasho Karma Ura is the President of the Centre for Bhutan & GNH Studies, Bhutan. The event marks the impending release of his two-volume book, "Bhutan: The Unremembered Nation". Volume I is subtitled ‘Community and Livelihood’, and it unfolds with accounts of births and rebirths in a household, making of houses and matrimonies, rearing of children and livestock in a village, and husbandry of lands and forests. After sketching these fundamental aspects of existence, it details seasonable migration, backpack and caravan trade, and travel over different climatic and linguistic areas. Colours, sounds, and other sensory experiences of ordinary people are described before ending on the rhythm of farming of major crops such as millet, maize, rice, and wheat. Volume II is subtitled ‘Art and Ideals’ and discusses the monumental architecture of dzongs (castles), administration of the country, authority and power, cosmological concepts and rites, visual arts and meditation, folk festivals and faiths, that animate the daily life of the people. Dasho Karma Ura will be in conversation with Dr Nitasha Kaul, Associate Professor (Reader) at CSD. A continuing strand of her research over time has been on small states and on different aspects of Bhutan's representation, political history, and international relations; she has further led research council awarded projects on Bhutan's democratisation, as well as on Bhutan as a biodemocracy that links politics and ecology. This event will provide an excellent opportunity for students, scholars, policymakers, and other guests to learn about Bhutan and its relevance in the international system. The conversation will be followed by an audience Q&A and a drinks reception. The event is open for all to attend, prior online registration via Eventbrite is mandatory.

Title: University of Westminster Q+ Queer Leadership Training | University of Westminster
Info: Students and colleagues are welcome to join our training session on Queer Leadership, delivered by We Create Space describes the training session this way: "A live conversation exploring how we can use our own personal stories to find power, purpose and drive wider social change within our organisations, communities and beyond. If we think of our values as the guardrails for how we live our life (make decisions, act, and react), then purpose functions more as a north star, as one overarching, ultimate goal that guides us. Purpose is like setting your own long-term strategy of what you’d like to achieve in life. We find purpose in the stories we tell ourselves and others. Within our organisations, the stories we choose to tell can shape our experience and our legacy. To drive change forward it is essential to make purpose personal – and dive into who are as individuals – but also collective – bringing together our values, strengths, and power. During this session, we’ll explore how understanding our own narrative and purpose enables us to drive impact with purpose in our organisations, communities and wider society. Our guest speakers will be sharing their inspiring stories and unique lived experience through the lens of their different LGBTQ+ intersecting identities. Attendees hope to gain some insight and perspective as well as some practical advice around creating more positive influence and impact in the world." - We Create Space .

Title: Pride Belongs to the People: Images of Soweto Pride exhibition opening party | University of Westminster
Info: Join us for the opening party for the exhibition, Pride Belongs to the People: Images of Soweto Pride, presented by Daniel Conway and Alex Green. The exhibition documents the struggles, circumstances, and demands of black LGBTQ+ activists in Soweto, South Africa. Johannesburg hosted the African continent’s first Pride march in 1990. Yet Pride in Johannesburg has been the focus of controversy and division for most of the post-apartheid period, and in particular, since the 2012 parade was disrupted by black lesbian and non-binary protestors. These divisions mirror broader socio-economic, spatial, and ethnic tensions in South African society, but also reflect divergent beliefs about the purpose of Pride, who it should represent, and what issues it should engage with. Johannesburg is now a city of at least three public Pride events, Soweto Pride, Ekurhuleni Pride, and Johannesburg Pride, with none taking place in the streets of the city centre. These separate Prides have emerged out of a fraught and complex history of LGBTQ+ organising, but also reflect the distinctive geographical, social, and political contexts of the city. Soweto Pride, organised by the Forum for the Empowerment of Women (FEW), a black queer and feminist women’s NGO aims to raise issues faced by black, LGBTQ+ South Africans, and in particular the widespread homophobic and gender-based violence faced by black lesbians from so-called ‘corrective rape’ to murder. The exhibition includes pictures taken at Soweto Pride in 2018 and extracts from interviews with LGBTQ+ activists. The exhibition draws from research funded by the Leverhulme Trust and is supported by the School of Social Sciences, University of Westminster’s Knowledge Exchange Fund. Dr Daniel Conway is a Senior Lecturer in Politics and International Relations at the University of Westminster. He is the author of ‘Whose Lifestyle Matters at Johannesburg Pride? The Lifestylisation of LGBTQ+ Identities and the Gentrification of Activism’, Sociology, (2022), vol. 56, no. 1: pp. 148-165. Alex Green is a part-time artist and writer. By day he works in digital at Citizens Advice, an organization that provides advice and support to some of the most marginalised in UK society.

Title: Plenary talk: Calm down Dear! Womens linguistic participation in UK Political Institutions | University of Westminster
Info: will give a plenary talk, ‘Calm down Dear!’ Women’s linguistic participation in UK Political Institutions, at the ICAME conference taking place 27–30 July 2022. The will be hosted by Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK. The theme of ICAME 43 is ‘Corpus Linguistics: a new normal?’: As we move into the third decade of the 21st century, what has changed, what has stayed the same, and is there a ‘new normal’ in corpus linguistics? Dr Sylvia Shaw will give a plenary talk, ‘Calm down Dear!’ Women’s linguistic participation in UK Political Institutions. The underrepresentation of women in politics is a persistent and seemingly intractable problem for British politics. In this paper I discuss some of the findings from my 2020 book, Women, Language and Politics in which I attempt to use theoretical and methodological sociolinguistic approaches to discover some of the obstacles and barriers that women in politics face. Researchers of political institutions are greatly helped by the wealth of data available to them in the analysis of political discourse from video recordings and written records to in-situ observation and large searchable datasets. Here I discuss some of the advantages of combining approaches to identify patterns of participation across different institutions. In doing so, I discuss analyses of parliamentary data from The Scottish Parliament; the Northern Ireland Assembly; the Welsh Assembly and the House of Commons. I also consider some of the pitfalls with conducting gender and language research, including oversimplifying the notion of a ‘women’s’ or ‘men’s style of speech, and failing to recognise the ideological underpinnings of beliefs about gendered behaviour.

Title: WFLL Annual Lecture | University of Westminster
Info: We are delighted to announce a new date for the Westminster Forum for Language and Linguistics Annual Lecture. The lecture, with Professor Alison Phipps, will take place on Thursday 23 June 2022 at 5pm in Fyvie Hall in our Regent Street building and followed by a reception in the Foyer. of the University of Glasgow, has been spearheading debates about decolonising the study of multilingualism, and has kindly agreed to come and talk about this. Her lecture, entitled Languages and Permacultural Justice: Decoloniality and Multilingualism promises to be a fascinating and thought-provoking event. Professor Alison Phipps “Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.” Much of the struggle against language death, or linguacide or language attrition is researched and studied under rubrics of counting and auditing the extent of the loss of diversity and economic benefits, or through the appeal to language rights. In this respect the considerable endeavours of scholarship, which have also been critiqued for the varieties of metaphors deployed – from kinship to ecology and beyond – remains within at best what Pureza (2005) refers to as the two ages of the common heritage of humankind. In this talk I will consider the possibility of a third age which might see the intangible and tangible common cultural heritage of humankind as amenable to the framings and exemplars offered by the concept of cultural justice. Resting on the normative directions offered by Article 27, and the critical engagement of indigenous and migrant-led scholarship with its relatedness to land, earth, lore and language, and the more than human world, I will offer some tentative suggestions as who we might consider safeguarding epistemic and ontological linguistic heritage for moving towards a third age of common heritage of humankind. Starting from painful experiences taken from the decoloniality of those subject to linguicide and epistemicide this lecture will begin to elaborate regenerative and restorative ways of enabling both thinking about and through multilingualism to enable people to begin to exercise their Article 27 rights, in scholarship, in scientific endeavour, in the arts and in cultural life. Expect poetry, proverbs, music, interruptions and some prose.

Title: Supporting multilingual classrooms: Plurilingual and inclusive education in migration contexts | University of Westminster
Info: , Professor of Languages and Interdisciplinary Pedagogy and President of of , the International Federation of Language Teacher Associations, an NGO of UNESCO and the Council of Europe, will talk at the FIPLV World Congress in Warsaw taking place 27–29 June 2022. This year is particularly special since it is the FIPLV’s 91st anniversary. Recent waves of forced migration from the Middle East and Ukraine have provided a fresh impetus to questions of inclusion and integration in language (and other) classrooms. How do we provide a school environment which enables youngsters from a migration background to feel a sense of belonging, even when they have very limited capacity in the languages employed in the school? In which ways can we include diverse languages in the curriculum in order to enhance all students’ learning? How can mainstream schools collaborate with local communities to the benefit of all? In this practice- and research-based talk I will mainly draw on the work of the Supporting Multilingual Classrooms activities co-funded by the European Union and the European Centre for Modern Languages of the Council of Europe. These include workshops in a range of countries, which enable educational practitioners and policymakers to reflect on their assumptions regarding multilingualism and plurilingualism in educational contexts. I will also include some reflections on the application of digital technologies during the pandemic as well as sharing some creative activities that can engage learners within and beyond their multilingual classrooms. Furthermore, I will make reference to the Council of Europe’s recent Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to member States on the importance of plurilingual and intercultural education for democratic culture.

Url: https://www.westminster.ac.uk/events/call-for-papers-first-biennial-international-conference-of-alevism-studies
Title: Call for papers: First Biennial International Conference of Alevism Studies | University of Westminster
Info: Alevism and Alevi communities are increasingly attracting research interest and publications from interdisciplinary perspectives and gaining recognition as an emergent field of academic study. This conference aims to bring together new and established scholars from different disciplines and perspectives for a lively and productive discussion of the issues and challenges related to research on Alevism and in collaboration with Alevis. A further aim is to raise the profile of this field of study through networking to create an international community of Alevis(m) research scholars. Within the current global political climate, especially in the Middle East, where religion is a vital factor in defining national identities and dividing ethnic groups, the position of Alevis and Alevism is being redefined both by the Alevis themselves and external agents such as religious bodies and nation-states. These recent changes have brought new questions into the research agenda, such as the relationship between Alevis and other minoritised religious groups in the Middle East and the significance of Alevi movements in the diasporic context. The research on Alevism and Alevis tends to focus on defining Alevism in terms of either/or binaries, e.g. religion or faith, outside or inside Islam or the oldest or a newer religion. While this approach has made a significant contribution to the field, it has been challenged by the diversity of experiences of Alevi communities worldwide. Another strand of research on Alevism has been focusing on the ongoing assimilation and persecution of Alevis and their survival strategies and experiences in their countries of settlement. This conference will address this complexity from a multi- disciplinary perspective within the wider global context. In this regard, we would like to invite papers from established academics and new researchers from different disciplines. Themes may include but are not limited to: Panel suggestions on specific topics are also welcome. The conference is being organised by Dr Umit Cetin and Dr Celia Jenkins from the School of Social Sciences, University of Westminster and Dr Berfin Emre from the University of the Arts London. The conference will be hosted by the Centre for the Study of Democracy and take place at the University of Westminster, London, on 5–7 July 2023, and we very much hope you will be able to participate in the conference and its wider project to create an international network of Alevi researchers. . Accepted papers will be notified by 15 December. There is no attendance or registration fee for the conference.

Title: What Next for Arms Control and International Law? | University of Westminster
Info: An examination of the history of nuclear arms control law to make the case for a new generation of treaties between the three superpowers. Speaker: Professor Daniel H Joyner, University of Alabama Chair: Professor Marco Roscini Location: LG.14, Portland Hall 4-12 Little Titchfield Street London W1W 7BY During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union created a web of bilateral treaties that were designed to stop the dangerous nuclear arms race, and facilitate a reciprocally coordinated implementation of agreed limits on the number of strategic nuclear weapons and delivery systems deployed by the two countries. However, over the past two decades these treaties have gradually disappeared through termination and withdrawal, until now there is only one bilateral nuclear arms control treaty left between the United States and Russia. The New START treaty is itself scheduled to terminate in February 2026. If that happens, there will be no nuclear arms control treaty in effect between the US and Russia for the first time since 1972. Professor Joyner will examine this history and use it to contextualise the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), a disarmament treaty that was adopted by the United Nations in 2017. He will argue that while well meaning, the TPNW will likely play only a minor diplomatic role in the future of nuclear weapons regulation in international law, and that what is needed is an urgent renaissance of attention to creating a new generation of carefully negotiated nuclear arms control treaties among the United States, Russia, and China. This new treaty regime will need to be adapted to the current tripolar nuclear reality, as well as to the full range of nuclear weapons in arsenals, and to related emerging conventional technologies including hypersonic delivery vehicles and artificial intelligence.

Title: London Summer School | University of Westminster
Info: The first summer school about migration at the University of Westminster. This event brings together more than 100 experts, teachers, PhD candidates, NGOs, including teachers and professionals from the University of Palermo, the Université de Tunis El Manar, the Université de Tunis, the Université de La Manouba, the University of Westminster, University of Granada, Unimed, and the organizations Cooperazione Per lo Sviluppo dei Paesi Emergenti Onlus (COSPE) and Clinica Legale Per i Diritti Umani (CLEDU). This is the second Summer School organised by the Erasmus Plus Project MIGRANTS. The first one took place in Granada in July 2022. The MIGRANTS project intends to reinforce the institution capacity of the Tunisia Higher Education System through a broad multi-stakeholder partnership to enhance the provision of Tunisian higher education and its relevance for the labour market and society. The London Summer School will be a unique opportunity to share ideas and perspectives on issues related to migration, its management and representation. This will be done through a series of roundtables with speakers from all the international institutions involved on the topics of discourses and representation, human rights and labour. The impact of multiculturalism in London will be celebrated through City Tours in three of the areas affected by migration (Arabic community in Edgware, Chinese community in Soho and French community in Kensington). A roundtable with doctoral students from the Erasmus Plus Project and the Westminster University research centre HOMELandS will take place on Wednesday 7 September. On Thursday 8 September, the Summer School will host an Advocacy Roundtable organised in partnership with Migrant Voice around the topic of externalisation of borders that will involve a series of London-based organisations including Amnesty International, Migration Observatory, Migrant Organise, Women for Refugee Women, and others. The screening of the documentary, Hostile, and a Q&A with director Sonita Gale will close the event. The film focuses on the UK’s complicated relationship with its migrant communities. Told through the stories of four participants from Black and Asian backgrounds, the film focuses on the impact of the evolving ‘hostile environment’ policies, which are designed to make living conditions so difficult for migrants that they voluntarily leave the country. The entire programme has been organised by the University of Westminster, led by Federica Mazzara, Hayet Bahri, Saskia Huc-Hepher, Rob William and Ailsa Peate, with the support and the collaboration of the partners of the project. The Summer School does not accept external participants since it is sponsored by the Erasmus Plus Migrants Project and it is reserved to the partners except for the last activity: the screening of Hostile, the documentary of Sonita Gale which is open to the public.

Title: Westminster Conversations: What is neurodiversity and why should I care? | University of Westminster
Info: The Westminster Conversations series will host an event on neurodiversity this December.

Rates of disclosure are low as people fear discrimination or misunderstanding, particularly those who are multiply marginalised. At this event, a diverse panel will discuss what neurodiversity means to them in their contexts (eg social movements, business, medicine or university). How can organisations better support neurodiversity? What are the benefits to doing this, for all of us, and why are our institutions and practices so often hostile to neurodivergent people? The event will be chaired by Dr Rachel Aldred, Professor of Transport and Director of the University's , with speakers including Char Bailey, Atif Choudhury, Dr Mary Doherty and Dr Elliott Spaeth.

Title: GL Brown Prize Lecture: Healing Tiny Hearts Across Generations | University of Westminster
Info: Did you know the risk of developing heart disease is determined not only by our genes but also by the state of the intrauterine environment that we experience before birth? Fetal hypoxia is a common pregnancy complication and is responsible for programming cardiac and endothelial dysfunction in offspring in later life. The mechanisms by which this happens remain elusive, preventing the identification of potential therapy. New research carried out by has led to the hypothesis that oxidative stress in the fetal heart and vasculature underlies how prenatal hypoxia programmes cardiac dysfunction in later life. In this talk, Professor Giussani will detail the physiology underlying this hypothesis, what he has discovered, and how these can be applied to modify the risk of heart disease not only in our children but also in further generations. The Physiological Society annually awards the to a speaker to showcase their impact and a successful career in physiology. The 2020 awardee, Dino Giussani, is Professor of Developmental Cardiovascular Physiology & Medicine, Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge.

Title: The 1990s takeover of womens leisure spaces | University of Westminster
Info: Focusing on the case study of women’s sports, Dr Rafaelle Nicholson shows how male control over women’s leisure lives increased in the 1990s. In 1998, Natasha Walter wrote in The New Feminism: "Everywhere you look, you see individual women who are freer and more powerful than women have ever been before." Walter's vision of the 1990s was of a decade of "Girl Power" where women had made significant progress toward equality and freedom. Were the 1990s as liberating a decade for women as Walter and her fellow "New Feminists" suggested? This seminar will attempt to address some of these questions by examining the 1990s through the lens of "leisure" – seen as one aspect of women's newfound freedom by Walter and others.

Title: The Robin Evans Lecture 2022 with Andrew Holmes | University of Westminster
Info: Join Andrew Holmes at the Robin Evans lecture, both in-person and online event, on the theme 'IMAGINATION: From Ink to Light'. Andrew’s personal view is not the conventional idea of imagination. He will be talking about his experience of drawing. During his working life, the digital revolution has enabled a transformation. The craft of pencil and ink on paper has been joined by the skill of drawing with light. Andrew is fascinated by the ways in which an idea in the mind can be represented to the outside world. The talk comprises an intense collection of images and visual effects. It offers observations about the unique quality of handicrafts and the elements of three traditions: Art is evidence, and an ability to select significant objects and experiences. Art is the residue of engaging the existing systems with particular mechanical techniques and processes. Art provides the possibility of fabricating new versions of reality. This series supports outstanding scholarship in the history of architecture and allied fields, building on the work of Professor Robin Evans (1944-1993). It encourages scholars working on the relationship between the spatial and social domains in architectural drawing, construction and beyond. Evans’ work interrogated the spaces that existed between drawing and building, geometry and architecture, teasing out the points of translation often overlooked. From his early work on prison design and domestic spaces, through to his later work on architectural geometry, Evans sought to articulate the multiple points at which the human imagination could influence architectural form. His first book, The Fabrication of Virtue, analysed the way that spatial layouts provided opportunities for social reform via their interference with morality, privacy and class. In The Projective Cast: Architecture and its Three Geometries, Evans traced the origins of the humanist tradition to understand how human form influenced architectural drawing and construction, focusing on aesthetic dimensions in the production of architectural space. This series will provide opportunities for the creation and/or dissemination of work by scholars working on similar questions of space, temporality, and architecture. In particular, it supports work that breaks the boundaries of traditional disciplines to think though these complex networks involved in the space between human imagination and architectural production. This year’s lecture will take place in the Robin Evans room at our in a hybrid format, with a number of places available for in-person attendance by students, staff and externals – in line with capacity for the room (100). Additionally, there is capacity for up to 500 to attend remotely via Zoom. You must register if you plan to attend.

The key aim of the project is to develop a survivor-centred, intersectional, decolonial and abolitionist theory and approach to prevent and better respond to SGBV in HE. We will do this by bringing together insights and experiences from survivors, activists, academics, and policy makers in the Global South, coupled with a strong focus on developing prevention strategies and building culture change in HE institutions. In developing new theory and approaches, the project aims to decolonise our dominant knowledges and understandings of SGBV in HE. This entails critically questioning the standpoint and perspective from which our information about SGBV comes from, as well as regarding how universities understand and deal with it. Crucially, it also means engaging with learning from institutional practices and feminist struggles in the Global South and applying these to how we address SGBV in HE worldwide. For this reason, this project will prioritise the mobilisation and amplification of scholarship and activisms from the Global South. The event will feature a unique theatrical performance along with a panel of speakers active in this field – more details soon to be announced! We would be delighted if you could join us to celebrate the launch of this important project, as we begin to make connections and start what we hope will be ongoing, productive conversations among our colleagues and partners working in this space. The event is open to all the students and colleagues of University of Westminster as well as members of public. Survivors, academics, activists, and practitioners working in the area of sexual and gender-based violence in HE are warmly invited to attend either in person or online. Registration is free but compulsory via .

Title: Mobility and Social Reproduction | University of Westminster
Info: Mobility and Social Reproduction: A Critical Legal Perspective on Migration, Asylum and Freedom of Movement. We are delighted to announce a series of events this semester, which showcase new research and publications in a variety of disciplines relating to democratisation, bordering practices, justice, anticolonial and antiracist pedagogies and feminist organising. This talk interrogates from the standpoint of Critical Legal Studies the entanglements between freedom of movement and social reproduction. On the one side, the conceptual separation between production and social reproduction lays at the centre of legal regimes of mobility control, on the other side, gendered transgressions of borders destabilise the very categories upon which law and politics maintain this distinction. The central argument that it is necessary today to interpret ‘the Stranger’ as a female stranger will be structured around two complementary arguments. First, there is the need to unmask the false neutrality of migration control and bring to light the violence of borders even when this is hidden behind the function of protecting ‘vulnerabilities’. Second, focusing on the role that mobility plays as an essential element in social reproduction, borders are seen as a multiplier of coercive social reproduction regimes that facilitate disenfranchisement and exploitation. Both arguments shed light on the limits of the legal notion of exploitation that is incapable of tackling the intersection between patriarchy, colonialism and capitalism in the contemporary global mode of production. is Associate Professor at the University of Roma Tre where she holds the chair in Philosophy of Law and coordinates a legal clinic program on migration and asylum. Her research interests include critical legal theory, theories of citizenship and border studies, and asylum and gender issues.

Title: Book launch: Animals in the International Law of Armed Conflict | University of Westminster
Info: The panel will discuss the findings of the recent book "Animals in the International Law of Armed Conflict". The panel discusses the findings of the recent book Animals in the International Law of Armed Conflict, edited by Anne Peters, Robert Kolb, Jérôme de Hemptinne. The book fills a lacuna in the scholarly writings on the law of armed conflicts. From an international legal perspective, both domestic and non-domestic non-human animals are forgotten actors. This is largely due to the anthropocentric nature of international humanitarian law, which treats non-human animals as objects or property. However, since animals are endangered, affected, exploited, and killed in situations of armed conflicts, it is important to explore how international humanitarian law applies to them. You are invited to join the editors of the book and some discussants to analyse in depth this fascinating new topic.

Title: History Research Seminar series | University of Westminster
Info: Justin Bengry presents his video history project ‘Queer Pandemic’ in association with Queer Britain. 'Queer Pandemic' is a video-based oral history project aimed at collecting stories about the experiences of LGBTQ+ people living across the UK during the era of COVID-19. Focusing on cross-generational dialogue, the project aims to explore connections between the pandemic and other crises experienced by LGBTQ+ people. ‘Queer Pandemic’ looks at how queer people's lives and communities have been shaped and strengthened by individual and shared responses to COVID-19 and previous crises. This event will take place both on Regent Campus and online (a zoom link will be sent once you’ve registered). The UK has undergone a series of recent constitutional changes as we move towards the UK’s post-Brexit constitution. Some people have argued that these changes show that the UK constitution is becoming more populist - although often this seems to be used more as an insult than a form of detailed criticism. This talk by Alison Young, Professor of Public Law at Cambridge, will explain when populism is dangerous, both generally and when applied to the UK’s unique un-codified, political constitution. This event will take place both on Regent Campus and online (a zoom link will be sent once you’ve registered). Political writer and broadcaster Rob Shepherd explains the Conservative leadership crisis of 1963 and how it continues to impact Britain's current governing party. The Conservative leadership crisis in October 1963 marks a pivotal moment in the party’s history and is striking for its high drama, personal intrigue and bitter recriminations. In this research seminar, Rob Shepherd recounts the chaos that ensued after Harold Macmillan resigned and looks at how the fallout from that moment in history is still being felt in the party today. This event will take place both on Regent Campus and online (a zoom link will be sent once you’ve registered). Dr Raf Nicholson discusses her research findings, which suggest that male control over women’s leisure lives actually increased between 1990 and 2000. This was because during this period women’s sports, including cricket, lacrosse, hockey, squash, and football moved from being governed by women-only organisations to a new form of “merged governance”, whereby an existing male-dominated body would take charge. Join as Dr Raf Nicholson reflects on these ‘mergers’ and whether or not the 1990s was actually a decade of regression, not progression, in relation to gender equality.

Title: The Conservative leadership crisis of 1963 | University of Westminster
Info: Rob Shepherd explains the Conservative leadership crisis of 1963 and how it continues to impact the UK's current governing party. The Conservative leadership crisis in October 1963 marked a pivotal moment in the party’s history and is striking for its high drama, personal intrigue and bitter recriminations. During this seminar, broadcaster and journalist Rob Shepherd will explain how this crisis continues to impact the Conservative Party today. When Harold Macmillan’s decision to resign was announced during the Tory party conference, there was no formal procedure for selecting a new leader, only vague ‘customary processes’. Among the leadership contenders, the 2nd Viscount Hailsham (Quintin Hogg) was ready from the outset to disclaim his peerage by means of the recent reform won by Anthony Wedgwood Benn, whereas the 14th Earl of Home (Alec Douglas-Home) had given Cabinet colleagues the impression that he had no intention of seeking the leadership. The party conference came to resemble an American-style nominating convention, as allies of the front-runners, Rab Butler, Quintin Hailsham and Reggie Maudling, canvassed support. Home’s eventual emergence as leader fuelled the suspicion that Macmillan had been determined all along to thwart Butler. In protest, two rising Tory stars, Iain Macleod and Enoch Powell, refused to serve in Home’s Government, whereas Edward Heath, who had backed Home, was rewarded with a promotion. Three months later, Iain Macleod wrote an excoriating attack on ‘The Magic Circle’ who, he claimed, had thwarted Butler. The Tories lost the 1964 election, and the following summer Douglas-Home stood down. In July 1965, Heath was elected leader by a secret ballot of Tory MPs, a method intended to prevent any repetition of the 1963 crisis – though perhaps one which has led to crises of different kinds. During a career in politics, writing and broadcasting, Robert Shepherd has talked with key players and witnesses of the 1963 Conservative leadership crisis. His books include biographies of Iain Macleod and Enoch Powell, and The Power Brokers: The Tory Party and Its Leaders. He worked at the Conservative Research Department, where he briefed Margaret Thatcher for her first visit to the US, and in 1979 became Special Adviser to James Prior. As a TV documentary producer, he won Europe’s ‘Prix Stendhal’ and a Reuter Fellowship for his fly-on-the-wall Channel 4 film shot inside the Foreign Office and Number 10 during the UK's 1992 EU Presidency. He produced a four-part series on post-war Britain, What Has Become of Us (Channel 4, 1993), with Peter Hennessy. For the BBC he produced Straight Talk with Andrew Neil and The Talk Show with Andrew Marr and Jonathan Freedland. His documentaries for BBC Radio 4 include The Prime Ministers with Nick Robinson; The Heath Enigma, 10 Days that Toppled Thatcher, Roy Jenkins and the Permissive Society, and Lord Gnome (on Private Eye’s 50th anniversary). He also produced Reflections with Peter Hennessy (biographical interviews with senior politicians), published as The Complete Reflections (2020).

Url: https://www.westminster.ac.uk/current-students/events/is-the-uks-post-brexit-constitution-populist
Title: Is the UK's post-Brexit constitution "populist"? | University of Westminster
Info: Professor Alison Young investigates whether the UK constitution has been undermined by post-Brexit populism. The UK has recently undergone a series of constitutional changes as we move towards the UK’s post-Brexit constitution. Some have argued that these changes show that the UK constitution is becoming more populist, although often this seems to be used more as an insult than a form of detailed criticism. This talk will explain when populism is dangerous, both generally and when applied to the UK’s unique un-codified, political constitution. It will argue that the UK constitution stands on a cliff edge and will suggest what changes may be needed to ensure the post-Brexit constitution does not push the UK into democratic decline. Professor Young researches all aspects of public law, both in the UK and the EU. Her main interest is in constitutional theory, particularly dialogue theory, drawing comparisons between different means of protecting human rights. She is also interested in comparative public law, specifically drawing comparisons between UK law, EU law, the law in other commonwealth countries and France, and in freedom of expression and the protection of human rights through private law. She has published widely in all of these areas, and her key works include 'Parliamentary Sovereignty and the Human Rights Act' (Hart Publishing, 2009). She was also the recipient of a Leverhulme Research Fellowship in 2015. This Fellowship led to a book on dialogue theory, 'Democratic Dialogue and the Constitution' (OUP, 2017), which was a runner-up for the main Inner Temple Book Prize, in 2018.

As a part of the Westminster Conversations series, we welcome everyone to engage in conversations to tackle the issue of SGBV in our workplace. The expert speakers will address issues such as survivor-centred, trauma-informed and intersectional approaches to understanding SGBV in higher education. A safe and inclusive university is the right of every staff and student within the university community. So this conversation aims to bring together different stakeholders to discuss how we can join as a community to support survivors and change cultures of patriarchy and violence that often shape higher education.

Title: Westminster Talking Therapies wellbeing workshop: Procrastination (online) | University of Westminster
Info: Procrastination is the act of putting off or delaying an activity that usually requires immediate attention because it is associated with feelings of unpleasantness. Although procrastination may seem helpful at the time, we may prolong the unpleasant feeling and increase our anxiety. Sometimes, procrastination can lead us to ignore tasks that may impact our lives on a larger scale as they seem overwhelming - writing an assignment, for example, or attending a doctor’s appointment, etc. Procrastination, however, is not inevitable. This interactive workshop will provide strategies and tools based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) that will help you to tackle procrastination, boost motivation and achieve your goals.

Title: Book Launch  Back to the Stone Age: Race and Prehistory in Contemporary Culture | University of Westminster
Info: Celebrate the publication of Ben Pitcher’s new book with Vron Ware, Subhadra Das and Sivamohan Valluvan. The event will be followed by a drinks reception from 6.30pm. Prehistoric human life is a common reference point in contemporary culture, inspiring attempts to become happier, healthier or better people. Exploited by capitalism, overwhelmed by technology and living in the shadow of environmental catastrophe, we call on the prehistoric to escape the present, and to model alternative ways of living our lives. In Back to the Stone Age: Race and Prehistory in Contemporary Culture, Ben Pitcher explores how ideas about race are tightly woven into the powerful origin stories we use to explain who we are, where we came from and what we are like. Using a broad range of examples from popular culture – from megaliths and museum mannequins, to television shows and best-selling nonfiction – Pitcher demonstrates how prehistory is alive in the 21st century. He argues that that the way we look back at our prehistoric past provides revealing insights into present-day anxieties, obsessions and concerns. Back to the Stone Age shows that the human past is not set in stone. By opening up the prehistoric to critical contestation, Pitcher places racial justice at the centre of questions about the existence and persistence of Homo sapiens in the contemporary world. is Visiting Professor in the Department of Gender Studies at the London School of Economics.

Info: University of Westminster and Franco-British Lawyers Society are proud to host the conference: Contract Law as an Instrument of Legal Predictability and Economic Attractiveness: A Franco-British Perspective. At a time of healthy competition between legal systems, to what extent can contract law be used as an instrument of legal predictability and economic attractiveness for parties involved in cross-border trade? Do the choice of law and the choice of jurisdiction matter for them in their commercial endeavours, particularly as private ordering of commercial and legal affairs gains in prominence in the current market? This conference will explore (1) the challenges and opportunities for legal predictability in contractual interpretation with senior judges from different legal traditions, and (2) the considerations in the choice of law through the prism of legal practitioners. A drinks reception will follow afterwards in the same building. Registration can be made using the Society’s email address: . There is no charge. All are welcome and it is not necessary to be a member of the Society to attend. Please indicate when registering whether you intend to join the event in person or remotely.

Title: Re-thinking Photographic Portraiture of 21st-Century Italian Migrants in the Arc Lmanique area - photography exhibition | University of Westminster
Info: In January, Ph.D. student Francesco Arese Visconti will be holding his final/VIVA photography exhibition at the London Gallery West at Harrow campus. No registration required. When Italians started to migrate to Switzerland after the end of World War II, they were the largest community of migrants in the Swiss Confederation. They contributed greatly to the prosperity of Switzerland, but always as external help, and they therefore struggled to get integrated into Swiss society. However, by the end of the 1970s, Switzerland began to change this unequal relationship and Italians were able to become part of the Swiss community. After a period of deceleration, at the beginning of the 21st century Italians once again started to heavily migrate to the Swiss Confederation. According to the Office Federal de la Statistique, in 2021 Italians were still the largest group of migrants in Switzerland. This phenomenon has, of course, an impact on different levels of Swiss society. The new diaspora is different in many aspects from the migration of the 1960s and 1970s. How can an image capture a complex, ineffable, and unrepresentable notion of modern Italian cultural identity? And how can an image represent the cultural identity of a group of people whose lives have been irrevocably altered by the experience of physically moving away from their homeland and resetting in a terra incognita? These photographs are an attempt to render visible the complex notion of this new migratory identity, of identity in flux, which is different from the common understanding of migration. The message of this work is that there is great value in telling the stories of these migrants, which are often underestimated. More information about the exhibition and Francesco's work can be found on his website: .

Title: W.E.T.: Women exhibiting together | University of Westminster
Info: Ten diverse international female artists explore the multifaceted nature of womanhood. 'W.E.T: Women Exhibiting Together' is a group exhibition that brings together works of ten diverse international female artists exploring the multifaceted nature of womanhood through different media. Taking place at the Project Space in London Gallery West, the exhibition is organised and curated by Eleanor Thirlway. W.E.T is an inclusive exhibition that brings together female artists from a range of backgrounds and working practices. The exhibition aims to juxtapose works in the hope that visitors and artists alike feel empowered to freely engage with the spectrum of womanhood presented. W.E.T believes that one size does not fit all as there is no one way to be a woman. W.E.T was born out of a desire to eradicate unhelpful archetypes that limit female complexities and experiences. By untangling histories, stereotypes, and language that devalues female expression instead of accepting comfortable categories that uphold a patriarchal society, we are proving that womanhood cannot be contained or strictly defined. The exhibition will launch with a private view on 29 November 2022, 5–8.30pm, and will continue through to 3 December 2022. General opening times: 10am–6pm daily.

Title: Stress and Worry (online workshop) | University of Westminster
Info: The human ability to ‘think ahead’ means that we can anticipate problems, and it allows us to plan effectively. As ‘thinking ahead’ can help us to achieve our goals, it can be seen as adaptive. Worrying, however, can quickly turn into unhelpful ‘thinking ahead’. To worry means to think about problems that might happen in a way that leaves you feeling anxious or apprehensive. Worry is experienced as a chain of thoughts and images that can progress in increasingly catastrophic and unlikely directions. It is often experienced as uncontrollable and seems to take on a life of its own. This practical workshop will share strategies to overcome stress and worry using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). It will give you tips on how to differentiate between helpful and unhelpful worries and how to tackle them. If you would like to , please contact Gina Casserly:

Title: For Us: trauma, colonialism and political solidarity among women survivors | University of Westminster
Info: Natália Corazza Padovani discusses trauma, colonialism and political solidarity among women survivors of state violence in Brazil. For Us (or Por Nós in Portuguese) is an association of women who were incarcerated at São Paulo state penitentiaries, in Brazil. The association was created by Brazilian, South African and Filipino women who met in prison while serving time. Upon leaving prison, each of them found many different obstacles. To South African and Filipino women, the challenges of 'freedom' were also related to their migrant situation. The aim of For Us association is to create a solidarity network between women released from prison, a network run by them and for them. They call themselves 'women prison survivors', which highlights that imprisonment is a deep traumatic experience. However, the trauma narratives of the prison experience also produce solidarity, which is articulated by these women as a political tool to forge meaningful connections with other women at the margins of the state. In this seminar, researcher and author Natália Corazza Padovani examines and discusses trauma and political solidarity among For Us members, contextualising them against the backdrop of colonial relations that produce subjectivities while also silencing traumatic experiences.

Title: Working with Whiteness - clay workshop | University of Westminster
Info: A series of three practical workshops using porcelain clay to discuss whiteness and antiracism – with artist and PhD researcher Victoria Burgher. In these practical, hands-on workshops, we will work with porcelain as a way of thinking together about the meaning of whiteness in society today. Participants will learn pottery-making and decorating techniques to produce their own ceramic porcelain pieces, which will be glazed and fired and can be taken home after the final session. We will learn about the material history of porcelain, in relation to Empire and colonialism, and discuss why porcelain is an apt material with which to consider symbolic whiteness. These workshops will be informal and relaxed, creating a safe, supportive environment in which to openly discuss whiteness, while engaging with the therapeutic qualities of clay. These sessions will run on three Wednesday afternoons in February. Refreshments will be provided. Participants will gain an understanding of the history of whiteness as a racial and social construct and discuss how it continues to embody and uphold white supremacy today. Participants will be able to reflect on how highlighting whiteness in this way is crucial to any antiracist social justice work. These workshops are inclusive and open to all and will create a sensitive and supportive environment in which to develop our racial awareness.

Title: Contemporary antisemitism: What it is and how to fight it | University of Westminster
Info: Is antisemitism a single historic continuum, or does it have distinct forms in different conditions? As part of our Westminster Conversations series, we invite students, colleagues and members of the public to an important discussion about antisemitism in contemporary times and strategies that can be used to raise awareness and challenge it. Recent years have seen far-right terror attacks in synagogues, prominent politicians and celebrities promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories, and intense debates about antisemitism in British life, including in left-wing politics. This panel discussion, featuring Jewish thinkers and activists from a range of backgrounds and perspectives, will look at the roots of contemporary antisemitism and discuss how it can be confronted. Is antisemitism a single historic continuum, or does it have distinct forms in different conditions? Does it manifest in different ways across different parts of the political spectrum? And can it ever be definitively uprooted, or merely held at bay? This event will help participants understand historic and contemporary manifestations of antisemitism, including discussing its parallels and differences from other forms of racism. Further panellists TBC Further information about the event will be sent upon booking.

The World in Westminster festival is open to all students and colleagues and will take place across all campuses including Cavendish, Harrow, Marylebone and Regent Street. Wherever you are based there will be something for you. Each day will focus on a different strand from our . These are culture, communication, expression, vision and belonging. Find out more and book your place to each of the following festival’s events: We are back and bigger than before! Come along and meet our student groups who shape, create and develop the culture at Westminster. Find your community at UWSU with over 30 cultural societies! Talk to our student leaders and find out about the amazing activities they will be doing this term and how you can get involved. What do you know about Latin American culture? We're inviting you to a multi-faceted event starting with a panel discussion with ambassadors from different Latin American states. We’ll discuss current events and issues, and there will be stands representing Latin American culture from north, south and central America. You’ll also get to see a photography exhibition of indigenous populations from Panama, take part in a Latin American trivia culture quiz (yes, there will be prizes), and enjoy Latin American music, food and a piñata. . Join the Student Mobility Team for a screening of “Granada Nights,” which was produced and directed by former Westminster student Abid Khan. Inspired by his own experiences, the director explores the benefits and challenges of studying abroad. The film itself addresses the theme of identity - focusing particularly on the main character’s identity as a British-Pakistani while studying abroad in Granada. The screening will be followed by a Q&A session with Abid around the topics of culture and identity. . No booking required. As part of International Women's Day, the Women of Westminster (WoW) network are hosting a panel discussion on the 'Broken Ladders' report. Women of colour across the UK already know that experiencing racism at work is the norm. The Fawcett Society partnered with the Runnymede Trust to produce their ground-breaking research, Broken Ladders: The myth of meritocracy for women of colour in the workplace. Broken Ladders centres the voices and experiences of thousands of women of colour at work and explores the different experiences of women. The skills, abilities, and experiences of women of colour should be harnessed and celebrated or our workplaces risk losing them – resulting in a huge loss of talent. That’s why the Fawcett Society are calling on employers, the government, universities, unions and businesses to take action now. No booking required. This live gig will consist of four unique student acts performing contemporary commercial music. We’ll hear from international students and multilingual performers who represent a range of cultures – reflecting our diverse student population. . Diversity is not just about how we look but the way we think. We invite you all to a panel discussion on the issues facing the neurodiverse community at our University. . The aim of this discussion is to look at the representation of minority communities in media and arts across the globe. This includes but is not limited to: Muslim representation in Bollywood, South Asian representation in Japanese animation, or representation of the black and LGBTQ community in Hollywood. . It's a highly contentious topic in the media, but what is refugee resettlement all about? We invite you to go beyond the labels and listen to real stories of real people - and their journeys. This event will also look at the results from a project supporting the social integration and sense of belonging on the part of Syrian refugees in UK society. . We often see brilliant Black individuals making waves in their industries. But where does this start? We've brought together three Black panellists to speak on the trials and successes of side hustling, how to manage wellbeing, how to triumph, make a difference and leave a legacy. . This event will bring together students, academics and support staff to celebrate diversity and inclusion at Westminster. Students will invite their colleagues to bring dishes from different countries, and we hope to hear from both student and colleague musicians. . More news and details around this amazing festival programme will be shared via the website and UWSU social media channels in the coming months, so watch this space... Come and immerse yourself in this celebration with us!

Title: Inaugural Professorial Lecture: Prof David Cunningham - Capitalism, Modernity and the Novel | University of Westminster
Info: Regent Street Cinema, 307 Regent Street, London W1B 2HW. Writing in 1800, the romantic critic Friedrich Schlegel famously proposed that if the literature of the ancient Greeks began with the epic, ‘our literature’ began, above all, ‘with the novel’. In this inaugural lecture Professor David Cunningham will discuss the different ways in which the novel has been understood as perhaps the distinctively modern literary genre, and why the novel emerged as a new literary form in the historical moment that it did. While much previous criticism has stressed the connection between the rise of the novel and the rise of a newly confident middle class in Europe, this lecture will consider the equally important links between the novel and the economic and social forms of capitalism. The lecture will discuss what this may have to tell us about recent developments both in the study of literature and in the contemporary novel itself. The lecture will be followed by a drinks reception in University of Westminster Regent St Foyer

At a time when trust in legacy media institutions and journalists is at a record low globally (Edelman, 2022) podcasts have emerged as a "safe space" for candid, authentic and intimate conversations (Markman, 2015; Berry, 2016). Trust between podcast hosts and listeners and among listener communities sharply counteracts the failures of the traditional mainstream. Through mixed methods research and exploratory factor analysis, this research investigates the qualities of the podcast industry that affect this phenomenon, and examines what can be extrapolated from these qualities to improve mass communication techniques in future times of crisis. Alexis Anthony holds a Bachelor's degree in Communication/Public Relations from the University of Maryland, a Master's in Media and Communication from the University of Strathclyde, and is pursuing her PhD in Media Research at the University of Westminster. She has worked as a marketing communications professional for nearly a decade, and has spent the last five years working in the podcasting industry. Alexis currently serves as a part-time lecturer in digital media and public relations at King's College London and the University of Westminster. This research examines the role of folk dancing as a means for the construction of ethnolinguistic identities in a diasporic context. Focusing on London’s Greek Cypriot diaspora in London, Eleftheria investigates the complexities of the language–identity–folk dancing nexus. Her research aims to examine ethnographic data through the lens of the linguistic and dancing practices, styles and procedures, scrutinising how folk dancing classes and performances operate as a context where heritage speakers can develop their ethnolinguistic identities. Eleftheria Sofroniou is a TECHNE-funded PhD researcher in Sociolinguistics at the University of Westminster. Eleftheria has studied Greek Philology in the University of Crete and she holds two Masters, one in Global Journalism from the University of Coventry and one in Contemporary History and Politics from Birkbeck, University of London. 152 Cayley Room, 309 Regent Street, University of Westminster, London, W1B 2HW

His career as a writer is usually neglected; only one of his works is part of the canon. His early writings (1826–37) have been dismissed or, at best, read autobiographically. However, this research argues that they are deeply engaged with redefining literature, literary genres and politics, at a time of transition between the Romantic period and the Victorian era. Baptiste Danel is currently a PhD student in English at the University of Westminster. Baptiste has a degree in English and an MA in English literature (with a specialisation in the literature of the nineteenth century). Baptiste’s PhD thesis focuses on the early writings of Benjamin Disraeli (1804-1881). Within democratic theory there is a growing interest in the possibility of using lotteries either to replace election to political office, or to create new institutions that complement elected bodies. This research will examine these proposals, assess their viability and generate ‘ideal type’ models for how these institutions could work. Tristan Long is a Doctoral Researcher at the School of Social Sciences where he is pursuing a PhD in Politics. He was born and raised on a dairy farm in South Wales before moving to study for a BSc in International Relations at Plymouth University and an MA in Politics at the University of Manchester. 152 Cayley Room, 309 Regent Street, University of Westminster, London, W1B 2HW

In this research, Ellen commissioned a fashion atelier to pattern cut two outfits – the 1930s Hollywood Casting Bikini and Two-Piece Skirt Suit – from the archive photographs of actress (and her own great aunt) Nita Harvey. She then wore the outfits to create a series of performance photographs where, dressed as Nita, she visited key Hollywood location sites documented in the archive. Through feminine embodiment of the costumes, Ellen activates the archive through empathic and affectual methodologies to create new discourse on Harvey's lived experience, objectification and hidden history. Ellen Nolan is a Senior Lecturer in Photography at Ravensbourne University, London. She holds a BA in Photography and an MFA. She formally worked as a successful photographer for British Vogue and i-D. Her artwork has been exhibited in Arles, France, The Photographers Gallery and The National Portrait Gallery, London, where it is part of their National Collection.

It touches on the former's practice of violence and hegemony on a global scale and contrasts this with the latter’s roles (functions) in relation to regional and global power structures, their adaptation mechanisms, their active undermining of civil society, and the resulting survival of their regimes. Hisham Bustani is an award-winning Jordanian writer of five books of fiction and poetry, scholar, activist and dental surgeon. His writing has been translated into a dozen languages; the latest, in English, is The Monotonous Chaos of Existence (Mason Jar Press, 2022). He has researched extensively on the postcolonial Arab state, utilising a multidisciplinary approach rooted in participatory action research, and published in a two-volume book in 2021. This is the basis of his current PhD by Published Work pursued at the University of Westminster's School of Humanities. This research aims to understand the news coverage biases in the television news and develop a base for the study of media literacy levels among middle-aged Indians.

This research aims to understand how family policy and ‘expert’ discourses of parenting impact upon and shape working-class mothering practices. ‘Good’ mothering is expected to remedy classed inequalities. Approaches fail to acknowledge structural inequalities, but this absence allows them to be ignored and attention instead focusses on mothers’ behaviour. Lorette Green is a fourth-year PhD student in Sociology with a background in teaching, having undertaken a BA in Primary Education in her late twenties at Leeds Trinity University. In 2018 she completed a Master’s in Early Childhood Education at Canterbury Christchurch University. This thesis investigates fake news and fact-checking based on class theory in the age of digital capitalism. Firstly, it discusses how false news has impacted working class consciousness in the pandemic era. Then, whether or not fact-checking platforms can help the contemporary working-class escape from the ideologies spread by false news is explored. Mi Jung Kim is a Media Studies MPhil/PhD student at the University of Westminster. Her supervision team consists of Dr Dimitris Boucas, Dr Pieter Verdegem and Professor Christian Fuchs (external). She graduated from Goldsmiths, University of London with MA in Media and Communications. She is a journalist covering Artificial Intelligence (AI) in South Korea.

Title: Climate and Energy Policy Lab - event series | University of Westminster
Info: The Committee on Climate Change estimates that the UK needs to increase the levels of investment in Net Zero technologies from around £10-15bn a year currently to around £50-60bn a year by the late 2020s. This talk will explore the strategies that the UK government is using to harness private sector investment into the energy industry and other Net Zero technologies. It will explore the idea of a ‘socio-technical transformation’ of sectors of the economy, involving a reconfiguration of the existing structure of sectors to new models that require the participation of different actors and resources. The talk will then explore the evidence and methodologies that are used within government; and how to access opportunities to work in the UK civil service. Ben Fagan-Watson is the Head of the Green Finance team in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in the UK government. He works in the broader Net Zero Strategy Directorate, which is responsible for keeping the UK on track with its climate change goals. Prior to this, Ben worked at the Policy Studies Institute at the University of Westminster where he carried out social research projects on topics including policy evaluation, reducing food waste, corporate lobbying on climate change, children’s travel around their neighbourhoods, and community resilience to heatwaves. He has also played a key role in running a policy evaluation research centre at the University of Surrey; was Head of Government Relations at a global NGO called CDP; and worked as a campaigner at ShareAction. The sustainability industry relies heavily on instruments such as standards, certification schemes and rating tools, and many jobs will rely on implementing such standards. This talk examines standardisation through a critical lens and explores the types of roles available in the sustainability industry for graduates who do not have a background either in science or engineering. The workshop will also provide a general introduction to report-writing skills, for use in a research, policy or business context. Dr Jan Gerhards holds a PhD from the University of Westminster for a thesis entitled: ‘One Planet Living and the legitimacy of sustainability governance: From standardised information to regenerative systems’ (2021). Jan’s professional experience includes teaching, tutoring, research, and working in various analytical and digital roles in SMEs and start-ups. Since completing his PhD, Jan has been freelancing, including working on a research project on active travel at the University of Westminster together with Dr Greenwood. The responsibilities of businesses for the impacts of their operations on the environment, the economy, society and local communities and individuals have increased over the past two decades. At least in part, this development has been driven by growing awareness of, and advocacy concerned with, the unmitigated impacts of large-scale investment projects. This has led to a body of international ‘soft’ law comprising principles, guidelines and standards seeking to regulate corporate conduct. Much attention has been paid to the negative local impacts of investments in the extractive industries (oil, gas, mining) and infrastructure. With the global need to transition to renewable sources of energy and invest in climate mitigation, the question of how to conduct business responsibly now also concerns ‘green’ investments. This talk will focus on the challenges for businesses and the career opportunities in this field. Dr Evelyn Dietsche leads the Business & Peace programme of swisspeace, an affiliated institute of the University of Basel (Switzerland), on the back of two decades of corporate and advisory work experience, primarily in the energy and minerals sector and the international development sector. Her work has focused on country and corporate risk analyses and sustainability issues, including corporate social performance and responsible business conduct. She holds a PhD from the University of Dundee’s Centre for Energy, Petroleum and Mineral Law and Policies, as well as an MSc in Development Economics from the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London and a postgraduate diploma in Political Science and Public Policy from the University of Konstanz. The liberalisation of Europe’s energy markets was one of the major developments that followed the collapse of communism more than three decades ago, triggering a period of free trade and wealth creation. However, with Russia’s war in Ukraine, the transition to a greener economy and a trend towards deglobalisation as well as  the ideological underpinnings of Europe’s electricity and gas markets are coming apart. The workshop will analyse the causes that are leading to this new pivotal shift and attempt to provide an outlook to Europe’s energy markets of the future. Bio: Dr Aura Sabadus is a senior journalist specialising in energy markets for ICIS and a research fellow of the Energy Community. For the last 13 years, Aura has focused on gas markets in Eastern Europe, Turkey and the Caspian region, taking a particular interest in market liberalisation as well as regulatory and political risk for the energy sector. Aura is frequently quoted in international media and contributes articles to international think tanks such as the Atlantic Council or the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). She holds a PhD in International Relations from King’s College London where she wrote a thesis on the liberalisation of the Turkish natural gas market.

Title: Book launch: New Migrations, New Multilingual Practices, New Identities | University of Westminster
Info: A panel of migration experts will reflect on the findings of the book New Migrations, New Multilingual Practices, New Identities: The Case of Post-2008 Italian, in conversation with the author, Giulia Pepe. New Migrations, New Multilingual Practices, New Identities: The Case of Post-2008 Italian (Palgrave MacMillan) explores the linguistic repertoires of new Italian migrants in London and the multilingual practices in which they engage. Italian mass emigration restarted after the 2008 economic crisis, but this new migration continues a long tradition: Italians migrated en masse after the country’s unification and after the Second World War. In the UK, they mainly emigrated after the Second World War to industrial towns, such as Bedford. In contrast, London has become the favourite destination of the post-2008 crisis wave. In the last decade, scholars focused on the social differences between past and new migrants, while the last linguistic study on the Italian community in London was carried out in the 1990s. The research at the basis of this book fills this gap. Recorded data collected through ethnographic observations of social gatherings organised by new migrants is presented to show how migrants communicate multilingually and use multilingualism to negotiate their (new) social and professional identities. Interview data is also used to further explore and better understand participants’ ideologies around multilingualism, migration and their sense of belonging to and perception of the Italian community of London. The panel will be chaired by Petros Karatsareas (University of Westminster) and will feature: This event is jointly organised by the and (Hub on Migration, Exile, Languages and Spaces) of the University of Westminster. .

Title: IPSE Business start-ups webinar: Why getting started with freelancing whilst at university might just be the perfect time to do it | University of Westminster
Info: Clelia Bevillard, Senior Student Enterprise Manager for the Westminster Enterprise Network (WeNetwork), and Kareena Ravaliya, Westminster student and Freelance Graphic Designer, will be guest speakers for this online webinar, hosted by , Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed in the UK. Clelia will cover guidance for students who are thinking about getting started with freelancing during their studies and Kareena will share her experience engaging with the support offered by the University of Westminster and the reality of starting freelance work. There are many reasons why freelancing is an employment type which attracts early-career professionals and makes them highly employable. This webinar will give an overview of what freelancing as a student looks like and share best practice to do it successfully. There were around 4.2 million self-employed professionals in the UK as of November 2022, despite a fall because of the covid-19 pandemic on the employment market. The majority age group within the self-employed remains those aged between 45-54 years old however with the development of technology and online communications, the democratisation of digital skills, and the rise of portfolio careers, self-employment is on the rise again. When students work with clients on real projects on their own terms whilst continuously developing their technical skills on their university course, students build a solid foundation to launch their careers. Building a professional network and a personal brand for yourself are key components of a thriving career, and freelancing gives you the opportunity to do just that. Saying that, freelancing does require determination, resilience, and self-confidence and sometimes will involve challenges and failure. In this session we will also cover practical tips to manage the transition to working for yourself successfully with the experience of a student freelancer. There will be plenty of opportunity to ask questions during the session, but you can also submit them in advance when registering for the event, or by emailing them through to . This session is free of charge to attend for both members and non-members but registration is essential. This webinar will be hosted on Zoom Webinar.

Title: TRAPPED: Immobility in Times of Migration | University of Westminster
Info: When we talk about migration, we tend to think about spatial movement. Not much attention is paid, however, to the implications that policies and regulations have on the actual act of moving and the associated sense of belatedness, immobility and waiting. This politicised ‘temporal disbelonging’, as Shahram Khosravi has defined it, is what this event wants to explore from various perspectives, including the immobility of asylum seekers in detention centres, the immobility of undocumented people at borders and the immobility of people of Caribbean descent who have seen their rights to stay in their home country put at risk by an ill-managed system. This event is led by Dr Federica Mazzara, Reader in Cultural Studies at the School of Humanities, University of Westminster. Fyvie Hall, 309 Regent Street, London, W1B 2HW

However, as anyone who has experienced them will know, panic attacks can be very unpleasant and distressing. In this interactive workshop, learn why we have anxiety, how it stimulates the fight-or-flight response in us, and what the resultant physical symptoms – which we often misinterpret when having a panic attack – really mean. You will also explore evidence-based techniques for overcoming panic attacks used in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).

Title: Westminster Forum for Language and Linguistics Annual Lecture 2023 | University of Westminster
Info: We are delighted to announce a new date for the Westminster Forum for Language and Linguistics Annual Lecture. This lecture, with Professor Alison Phipps, will take place on Thursday 23 March 2023 at 5pm in Fyvie Hall, 309 Regent Street, and will be followed by a reception. Professor Alison Phipps of the University of Glasgow has been spearheading debates about decolonising the study of multilingualism, and has kindly agreed to come and talk about this. Her lecture Languages and Permacultural Justice: Decoloniality and Multilingualism promises to be a fascinating and thought-provoking event. We hope you are able to join us. Professor Alison Phipps “Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.” Much of the struggle against language death, or linguacide or language attrition is researched and studied under rubrics of counting and auditing the extent of the loss of diversity and economic benefits, or through the appeal to language rights. In this respect, the considerable endeavours of scholarship, which have also been critiqued for the varieties of metaphors deployed – from kinship to ecology and beyond – remains within at best what Pureza (2005) refers to as the two ages of the common heritage of humankind. In this talk, I will consider the possibility of a third age which might see the intangible and tangible common cultural heritage of humankind as amenable to the framings and exemplars offered by the concept of cultural justice. Resting on the normative directions offered by Article 27, and the critical engagement of indigenous and migrant-led scholarship with its relatedness to land, earth, lore and language, and the more than human world, I will offer some tentative suggestions as who we might consider safeguarding epistemic and ontological linguistic heritage for moving towards a third age of common heritage of humankind. Starting from painful experiences taken from the decoloniality of those subject to linguicide and epistemicide this lecture will begin to elaborate regenerative and restorative ways of enabling both thinking about and through multilingualism to enable people to begin to exercise their Article 27 rights, in scholarship, in scientific endeavour, in the arts and in cultural life. Expect poetry, proverbs, music, interruptions and some prose.

Title: DAR Study Group: Discussion of Privilege | University of Westminster
Info: Brought to you by the Pedagogies for Social justice project at the UoW, DAR (decolonisation and anti-racism) fosters dialogue and learning for social change in HE. You are invited to the third gathering of the DAR study group: your modern-day book club that aims to foster the learning and dialogue that is needed in any effort towards social justice in higher education. This session is dedicated to understanding privilege and, in particular, the importance of recognising our privileges and identifying the situations in which we benefit because of them. Privilege typically refers to the unearned advantages we have because of different aspects of our identity. For instance, being able-bodied, cis-gendered, young, heterosexual, and white or white-passing are all examples of the different characteristics that can afford individuals privilege within certain systems and social situations. Intersectionality theory is useful for understanding privilege as it highlights that the different elements of our identity overlap and intersect to create our experience of privilege and discrimination. Some individuals face multiple barriers but also hold certain privileges, which compound to create unique challenges. And although we cannot control the amount of privilege we have, we do have some control over how we use our privilege to demonstrate allyship, hence this session will also consider the ways in which our privilege can be used to help others. We offer a space that facilitates the analysis and discussion of texts, media and news, in the hope that you will join us as we call these into question, reflect on our own ideas and practices, and stretch our understandings beyond the colonial and racist confines of the academy. The study group is brought to you by the Pedagogies for Social justice project, which is a student-staff partnership at the University of Westminster, hence this invitation extends to all students, academics and staff across the institution.

Title: Co-creating meaning and re-imagining ourselves in the University: play-doh as a generative method | University of Westminster
Info: Building meaningful partnership relationships and co-creating our learning and teaching realities requires trust and a safe space. In this seminar, Dr Fatima Maatwk will reflect on using play-doh to collectively co-create meaning in student partnerships. Moving away from traditional research methods, which often mirror the imbalanced power dynamics in HE, we use play-doh as a generative and creative method to centre our partnership relationships on trust and care. It is a process that allows meaning to emerge and enables us to connect with parts of ourselves in a way that asking and answering questions or writing about concepts does not. Collectively reflecting and building our models allows us to ‘feel’ our way through the answers to our guiding questions. In doing so, we aim to disrupt how knowledge is produced and circulated in institutions. Dr Fatima Maatwk is a Lecturer in Student Partnership, in the Centre for Education and Teaching Innovation at the University of Westminster. She will be joined by respondents Rifa Ferzana, BA Computer Sciences Student & Student Partnership Ambassador, University of Westminster, and Dr Andy Pitchford, Head of the Centre for Education and Teaching Innovation, University of Westminster.

"Aidan Hehir narrates a road trip that captures with precision the uneasy interaction between even the most sympathetic outsider and those who have survived genocide. From beginning to end, the author never ceases to find wanting the moral disengagement of bystanders, including himself." – Anna Di Lellio, PhD, Professor of Politics, New York University "Srebrenica, and what happened there is such a devastatingly huge subject, the scale of it hard to digest. And yet Aidan Hehir draws out the human elements of the story with delicacy, elegance and wit. He finds a way to talk about genocide, trauma and memory, and the marks that such appalling acts leave on communities, with a rare lightness of touch and a poetic sensibility." – Natasha Tripney, theatre critic and journalist

Title: HOMELandS Dialogue: Improving resettlement planning | University of Westminster
Info: An in-depth discussion on refugee resettlement, part of . It's highly contentious topic in the media, but what is refugee resettlement all about? We invite you to go beyond the labels and listen to real stories of real people, and their journeys. The event will showcase results from a project on supporting the social integration and sense of belonging on the part of Syrian refugees in UK society. Refugee integration can be a traumatic experience, not least due to the profound and deep losses suffered by refugees prior to their arrival. Their resettlement therefore requires careful planning and attention to detail. We draw attention to the work of two organisations that support the integration of Syrian refugees and highlight some of the challenges they face in doing so. These same issues likely affect groups supporting the social integration of newly arriving Afghan and Ukrainian refugees, making it all the more imperative for policies and practices which can build cohesive societies. The event evidences university engagement with diversity, inclusion and internationalisation themes which underpin the World in Westminster festival. In an ever ‘globalising’ world perpetuated by increased mobility, this event offers attendees an insight into the benefits of, as well as challenges in, building societies that support the wellbeing of all members, reduce exclusion and marginalisation and foster a sense of belonging and security, whatever the backgrounds and nationalities of its members. Attending the event are: Special thanks goes to Dr Maria Granados (Westminster University) and Christina Flora, Doctoral Student from the University of Westminster’s School of Humanities, who are also part of the research team.

Title: Labour Migration Research Group Research Showcase | University of Westminster
Info: The Labour Migration Research Group at the University of Westminster is delighted to showcase the work of its members and collaborators through a packed programme or presentations, imagery, narratives, and roundtable discussions. We will present research with a global reach, ranging from how migrants navigate their lives in uncertain and often coercive circumstances to the effects of inward and outward migration on sending and receiving countries and on migrants themselves. There will even be an opportunity to taste both familiar and more adventurous Greek and Italian dishes! The group’s members research the causes and effects of labour migration, the challenges faced by marginalised social groups and migrant workers during their stay in host countries and the extent to which regulation, policy and advocacy improve their rights and conditions. Find out more about the . The Regent Street Cinema, 307 Regent St., London W1B 2HW Federica Mazarra will draw attention to the large quantity of ‘debris’ and ‘waste’ (e.g. the life jackets) left behind after rescue operations. These objects are regarded as a symbol of the necropolitics of migration. She will highlight artistic and activist initiatives which have made use of these abandoned life jackets to instill a new meaning to them. Roza Tsagarousianou will present her research in the Moria and Kara Tepe camps in the Island of Lesvos, Greece, using photographs and asylum seekers’ and personnel camp narratives to highlight both the politics of control and the politics of resistance as they unfold in the camps. She will highlight the spatial and temporal arrangements in the camps as aspects of power implemented from within technologies of migration management, and as indicative of counter narratives and resistance by asylum seekers in the camps as they await decisions on their fate. The recent influx of Hong Kong immigrants into the UK through the British National (Overseas) Visa Scheme has led to a ‘brain drain’ and ‘asset run-off’ in Hong Kong. This influx will also inevitably strain the UK’s ability to provide public services. Through an on-stage live chat and using multi-media materials, Miu-Yee Wong will highlight the views of different generations of immigrants and the similarities and differences in their experiences. She will also present the multiple livelihood challenges new immigrants contend with in integrating into their new living environment. There is a complex relation between mobility of workers across borders and their immobilisation in worksites under coercive labour relations. My research focuses on the sites of labour (im)mobilisation, which means studying, through a spatial perspective, the circumstances, the tactics, and the relations that lead to mobility of workers, often migrants, being captured by employers. I analyse how labour coercion took place in different locations, explain why it is important to see those locations as interlinked for the purpose of historical analysis and unravel the social practices and processes that took place. I will illustrate my research through the use of animation, motion image and interviews. In this interactive event, the research team of the project will reconstruct the sites of their ethnographic research into Greek and Italian restaurants in London. The two corners of the Regent Street Cinema bar will be transformed into a Greek taverna and an Italian trattoria, where attendees will have the opportunity to immerse themselves into diverse dining experiences shaped by stimuli for all the senses of the human body. Everyone will have the opportunity to taste both familiar and more adventurous Greek and Italian dishes, while members of the team will guide the audience through negotiations and contestations of authenticity and food entrepreneurship. This study investigates the extent to which second generation ethnic minority immigrants in the UK have the same access to professional, high level and managerial employment in comparison with their native counterparts. Rukhsana Kausar and Issam Malki find that first generation native citizens have the highest probability for higher career attainment and that first generation immigrants perform better than second-generation native citizens and immigrants. Additionally, second generation immigrants have higher probability to attain higher professional careers but are less likely to succeed in managerial attainment. The research is relevant to understanding whether improvements to the career opportunities and progression of immigrant individuals are sufficient.  Stronger policy interventions at different levels (state, employer, education) may be required to facilitate this. Much public and policy concerns have focused on the distributional impacts of immigration – in particular, potential negative impacts on employment and wages for low-skilled workers. Vasoula Hadjivarnava will use a broadly analogous methodology to analyse the impact of Brexit on migration flows to the UK from the EU, produce scenarios for future flows, and provide plausible empirically based estimates of the likely impacts on growth, employment and wages. The broad scenarios she will depict through graphs and tables, imply that the negative impacts on per capital GDP will be significant, potentially approaching those resulting from reduced trade. She argues that the reductions in migration resulting from Brexit are likely to have a significant adverse impact on UK productivity and GDP per capita. Many factory women migrant workers in Malaysia contend with reproductive health needs. They have limited reproductive health knowledge and cannot access healthcare easily. Lilian Miles and Tim Freeman will present their recent research on the interventions their research team implemented in factories in Penang, Malaysia to support these needs. These consisted of reproductive health education, a mobile clinic and reproductive health counselling and referral services. How the interventions impacted factory women migrant workers’ reproductive health will be discussed, through images and women migrant workers' narratives. We are looking forward to welcoming you on the day.

Title: A Polyphonic Ghost Gig: Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac | University of Westminster
Info: Fleetwood Mac played at the Poly on 27 April 1968. 55 years later, we recreate the event, in the place it took place. Spring 2023 sees the launch of Polyphonic: A celebration of pop at the poly. In 2019 as part of the Out of the Archives funded project, a team including former student Alex Hancock, our previous archivist Anna McNally and Guy Osborn from Westminster Law School documented all the bands and artists that had played at the Polytechnic between 1966 and 1992, looking specifically at the political benefits that had taken place during the period. An event entitled 'Pop and Politics at the Poly' took place in the Soho Poly as part of the Being Human Festival in 2019. Building on this, and inspiring the restoration of Fyvie Hall and its celebration of musical spaces, funding was kindly provided by UEB for this Polyphonic initiative, which celebrates the history of musical performances, and performance spaces at the University of Westminster. As part of ghost gigs and found sounds, itself an element of Matt Morrison and Guy Osborn’s Disrupt the Everyday project, the musical spaces of the institution have already begun to be celebrated. From New Order and redksins at 115 New Cavendish Street, via Maureen Kennedy Martin at the Soho Poly, to online iterations of Donovan and Ralph McTell during the lockdown, former events have been re-imagined and celebrated. Even Fyvie Hall itself has been recognised and acknowledged via the Pete Shelley (buzzcocks) tribute of ‘Pop, and Politics at the Poly’. Polyphonic consists of a mini-exhibition, roving around our sites, with events taking place at LTS, Regent Street and NCS. These events are supported by a series of celebratory banners, a fanzine the size of a 7” vinyl single, and a spotify playlist of bands that have ‘played the Poly’.

Title: Responsible business conduct in renewable energy and climate mitigation investments - challenges and opportunities | University of Westminster
Info: Dr Evelyn Dietsche explores the challenges and opportunities for businesses in 'green' investments. The responsibilities of business for the impact of their operations on the environment, economy, society, local communities and individuals have increased over the past two decades. At least in part, this development has been driven by growing awareness of, and advocacy concerned with, the unmitigated impacts of large-scale investment projects. This has led to a body of international ‘soft’ law comprising principles, guidelines and standards seeking to regulate corporate conduct. Much attention has been paid to the negative local impacts of investments in the extractive industries (oil, gas, mining) and infrastructure. With the global need to transition to renewable sources of energy and invest in climate mitigation, the question of how to conduct business responsibly now also concerns ‘green’ investments. This talk by Dr Evelyn Dietsche will focus on the challenges for businesses and the career opportunities in this field. The event is hosted by the Climate and Energy Policy Lab, an exciting new unit run by climate change and energy policy experts at the University of Westminster. The Lab brings together external organisations, policymakers and stakeholders to deliver professional workshops and events for students. This event takes place in Room UG05, 309 Regent Street, London, W1B 2HW.

Title: Europes energy markets | University of Westminster
Info: The liberalisation of Europe’s energy markets was one of the major developments that followed the collapse of communism more than three decades ago, triggering a period of free trade and wealth creation. However, with Russia’s war in Ukraine, the transition to a greener economy and a trend towards deglobalisation, the ideological underpinnings of Europe’s electricity and gas markets are coming apart. This workshop by Dr Aura Sabadus will analyse the causes that are leading to this new pivotal shift and attempt to provide an outlook to Europe’s energy markets of the future.

Title: Challenging Antisemitism in Higher Education and Beyond | University of Westminster
Info: In addition to tackling explicit and unconscious antisemitism, how do we challenge ignorance and apathy where many people may not see antisemitism as a problem? The University of Westminster and London Higher’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) Network invite students and colleagues as well as members of the public to an important discussion about the challenges of antisemitism in the Higher Education sector and beyond. Recent years have seen a growing recognition that anti-Jewish animus is neither confined to history nor to the fringes of humanity, but is a part of everyday discourse in different sections of society. The Higher Education sector is not exempt from it. Institutions cannot tackle a prejudice if they do not recognise its presence in the first instance; policies won’t be effective if practices do not change. The Taskforce on Antisemitism in Universities runs under the auspices of both the All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism and the Government’s Independent Adviser on Antisemitism. Its report, out in March, will look at the experiences of Jewish staff and students across UK campuses. The report, based on meetings with over 40 UK Higher Education Institutions, relevant providers, and other stakeholders, will highlight key issues and provide recommendations on what more can be done to support Jewish staff and students on campus. The report will also be accompanied by a 'Good Practice Guide' containing numerous examples of policies, initiatives, and case studies from universities taking proactive steps to improve the experience of Jewish staff and student life on campus. The report of the Lord John Mann-led Taskforce on Antisemitism in Universities could not come at a more crucial time. Why was the report necessary? What are its main findings? How can the report guide institutions to bring about a culture change whereby antisemitism, like other forms of racisms and prejudices, is not tolerated? Lord John Mann will be in conversation with Professor Dibyesh Anand (University of Westminster and Chair of London Higher’s EDI Network) about the report, its findings, and the importance of taking it as a wakeup call for culture change.

What did the Taskforce learn about antisemitism in higher education and efforts to challenge it? Lord Mann will be in conversation with Professor Dibyesh Anand, a co-chair of University of Westminster’s EDI Committee as well as the chair of London Higher’s EDI Network, about the research that went into the report and the importance of taking it as a wakeup call for culture change. John Mann was the elected Member of Parliament for Bassetlaw from June 2001 until 2019. Since his time in student politics John Mann has been vocal in his condemnation of all forms of racism and has worked tirelessly to combat it. In the summer of 2005, he was appointed as Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group against Antisemitism (APPG), supported by the Antisemitism Policy Trust. John has commissioned two major All-Party Inquiries into Antisemitism and a further inquiry into Electoral Conduct. In 2008, John established the Inter-Parliamentary Coalition for Combating Antisemitism (ICCA) which he still Chairs. In May 2009, John received the American Jewish Committee's (AJC’s) Jan Karski Award in recognition of his commitment and work in fighting antisemitism. In 2010, he chaired the Football Association’s Task Force on antisemitism and Islamophobia in football. In July 2019, John Mann stepped down as Chair of the APPG when he was appointed the UK Government’s Independent Adviser on Antisemitism in one of Theresa May’s final acts as Prime Minister. John Mann joined the House of Lords in October 2019 as Lord Mann of Holbeck Moor. In February 2021, Kick It Out appointed Lord Mann as an Ambassador to support its work tackling discrimination in football.

Title: Franco-American emotional relations in the early Cold War 19481949 | University of Westminster
Info: This event is part of the History Research Seminars. In 1949, the French people sent 52,000 objects to Americans in thanks for their military aid in the Second World War, and their humanitarian aid ever since. The gifts – including vases, handkerchiefs, books, drawings, ceramic figurines, dolls, knitted baby hats, silk wedding dresses, military medals and smoking pipes – were packed into 49 antique boxcars and arrived in New York City in February 1949. The Gratitude Train, as it was known, drew in large crowds across the country, and celebrations were organised across the nation as each state received a boxcar. Afterwards, the gift objects were distributed to the public or preserved by state museums and archives. Through the little-known story of the Gratitude Train, Dr Ludivine Broch re-thinks transatlantic relations in the early Cold War period of 1946–49. An area of history typically examined through the lens of political tension and economic reconstruction, she asks what objects, emotions, and civilians can tell us about the complexity of those immediate postwar years, and about the politics of gratitude which helped shape the post-war world. Ludivine Broch is a Senior Lecturer in History at the University of Westminster. She is the author of Ordinary Workers: French Railwaymen, Vichy and the Holocaust (2016) which was published by Cambridge University Press and translated into French with Tallandier. She edited a volume on France in the period of the World Wars, has contributed chapters to edited volumes and has written several articles on the topic of rescue in the Holocaust, memory, railwaymen and most recently on colonial resisters in Vichy France. Her work has appeared in Diaspora, Contemporary European History and French Politics, Culture and Society. She is currently working on a history of material culture, emotions and international relations in postwar France which has been funded by the British Academy and Leverhulme.

This hybrid two-day event initiates a critical conversation about the largely overlooked space of the darkroom, and outlines new ways to research, theorise, and interpret the roles that it has played in our modern world. In the Photographic Darkroom will seek to do so by shifting the focus from the visual product (e.g., negatives and prints) to the setting itself within which these objects were produced, positing that the material, socio-cultural, and corporeal dimensions of the darkroom had an influence on how people conceptualised and, consequently, understood photography. This will enable us to rethink the role of photography in the development of modern visual culture, and its wider historical relations, from fresh viewpoints.

Title: What is decolonisation? Does it deliver, or does it disappoint? | University of Westminster
Info: Recently, the word 'decolonisation' has become the global 'buzz word' for academic institutions. The term promises a new critical posture of self-reflection and change. Decolonisation seems to aim at rooting out embedded colonial schemes of knowledge and practice. Recent debates seem to focus on curriculum reform and diversifying methodological practice. But what does the term actually mean and how useful is it when it is used in such varied contexts? Has decolonisation become the latest fad of 'Equality, Diversity and Inclusion' initiatives and promise little aside from paperwork and pointless gesturing? For this event, we have the pleasure of hosting Dr Leon Moosavi from the University of Liverpool, Dr Riadh Ghemmour from the University of London Central School of Speech and Drama, Professor Catherine Loveday and Professor Dibyesh Anand from the University of Westminster to discuss what decolonisation means to them and whether the notion of decolonisation really does have the potential to deliver on a more just and equitable society.

Title: Partner event: Women in Technology: Embrace Equity: The Journey towards Gender Equality | University of Westminster
Info: Gender equality continues to be a persistent challenge in Britain’s technology sector. Talented women are often sidelined when it comes to professional advancement opportunities, they regularly get overlooked for the most challenging programmes of work, and they are sometimes rewarded less generously than their male peers are. Despite industry efforts to promote greater equality and inclusion, the number of women in the sector remains low. Just 21% of IT professionals and 12.5% of engineers identify as women, and alarmingly the gender gap is projected to widen in some specialist technical disciplines. Netcompany - a key partner of the University of Westminster and member of the Chancellor’s Circle – will be hosting this question to a panel of some of the industry’s most influential and visionary technology leaders. At the end of the session, you’ll understand what the tech sector means for women, what the direction of travel is, and what it really means to ‘embrace equity’. Don't miss out on this extraordinary chance to connect with a remarkable cohort of women in leadership and learn about their journeys in the technology industry. Join us and gain insights on how they entered, remained, thrived, and led in the world of technology. Panellists include Rituja Ravikiran Rao, Senior Enterprise Project Manager at Deliveroo and University of Westminster alumna.

Title: Black History Year - Beyond Books: discussing Black identity representation in arts and culture | University of Westminster
Info: As part of the Black History Year programme, we want to discuss and highlight Black identity representation in arts and culture. Bringing this to life, we are launching BHY Beyond Books in April 2023 to review a series, book, and film that highlight Black British representation. To begin, we will review the award-winning series I May Destroy You (2020), written by and starring Michaela Coel. We will launch on the evening of April 27 with a screening of the last episode of I May Destroy You. This is an opportunity to delve deeper into Black history and explore the nuances of contemporary Black culture. We encourage all participants to watch the entire series, but it is up to you whether you watch the last episode before the screening or not. Either way, we invite you to join us for an engaging and thought-provoking discussion on Black history and culture. I May Destroy You premiered on BBC in 2020 and consists of 8 episodes. the programme explores the theme of sexual assault. The story follows the struggles and accomplishments of a Black British writer as she works on writing a book, maintaining a following, exploring a new relationship, and trying to make sense of a recent attack. By taking us through her creative process, Coel explores the psyche of an assault victim, while simultaneously challenging our own prejudices and judgments. The actress' unique storytelling style provides a brilliant depiction of what it means to be a woman and a young, Black Londoner. . BHY Beyond Books will explore topics such as femininity, rape culture, Black writers in the media, and the many poignant themes this series raises.

Title: Majority nationalisms in South Asia (Professor Katharine Adeney) | University of Westminster
Info: This paper, co-authored with Professor Wilfried Swenden at University of Edinburgh, lays out our understanding of majority nationalisms in South Asia. It reviews the rise of majority nationalism globally and links this to parallel debates on the rise of populism and the process of democratic backsliding, which some authors have also linked to the (crisis of) capitalism and the unfulfilled promise of economic globalization. It will identify similarities with and differences to the ‘Western’ interpretations and manifestations of majority nationalism, eg populism and populist leaders are not new phenomena in South Asia. Furthermore, in India, the rise of majoritarianism has also coincided with a deepening of the democratic base linked to the incorporation of non-dominant caste groups in the political process and the vernacularization of the media. At the same time, majoritarianism has challenged the liberal attributes of democracy across the subcontinent. It has been used to cut back civil liberties, such as limiting the freedom of expression or association and to restrict citizen access to alternative sources of information. By framing opposition to majoritarian views as ‘anti-national’ in all three countries it has also sought to delegitimise the voice of political opposition. Therefore, the entrenchment of majoritarian nationalism has had important implications for the working and health of democracy in the subcontinent. Our paper will identify channels which have been used to diffuse majority nationalism such as social media and the influence of the South Asian diaspora. It will conclude with a brief justification of our focus on 21st-century South Asia by linking contemporary debates/challenges back to the decisions taken at their birth. This is a hybrid event that takes place both on campus and online. If you would like to attend the event on campus, to book your place. The event will take place at the Westminster Forum, Fifth Floor, 32–38 Wells Street, London, W1T 3UW. If you would like attend the event online, please email the seminar convener, Dr Jac St John, Lecturer in Politics and International Relations, at . Dr Katharine Adeney is Professor of Comparative Politics at the University of Nottingham, and previously served as Director of the University's Asia Research Institute. Her principal research interests include majoritarianism in South Asia, especially India and Pakistan; ethnic conflict regulation and institutional design; the creation and maintenance of national identities; the politics of federal states, and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. She is currently co-authoring a monograph on Majoritarianism in South Asia with Professor Wilfried Swenden, building on their joint paper on whether India can be understood as a consociational democracy and her framework in Nations and Nationalism for assessing degrees of ethnic democracy in different countries, applied to India as a case study. The Centre for the Study of Democracy (CSD), established in 1989, is based in the School of Social Sciences at the University of Westminster.

Title: 'Democracy cant breathe': a democratic theory of life (Dr Hans Asenbaum) | University of Westminster
Info: Democratic theory makes ample use of the term 'life', in speaking of 'democratic life', the democratisation of every sphere of life, and democracy itself as living. Yet no comprehensive understanding of 'life' has yet been established within democratic theory. The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, arising in response to police brutality and systemic oppression, articulates the urgency of refocusing on life and its meaning. The article discussed in this event employs a grounded theory approach, enriched with participatory methods, to develop a radical democratic concept of life in conversation with the BLM movement. Drawing on interviews and a focus group with BLM activists, as well as analysis of the social media hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, the article conceptualises life as the existence of a perspective that evolves through its fundamental interconnectedness. 'Life' is understood as a process of life-making. The article then outlines living democracy as an ever-evolving assemblage, formed of the constantly changing perspectives of its participants. This is a hybrid event that takes place both on campus and online. If you would like to attend the event on campus, to book your place.

Title: Challenging Unhelpful Thoughts - online workshop | University of Westminster
Info: Thinking can be wonderful. It means we can plan, solve problems, create and imagine. People have thousands of thoughts every day. Some are helpful and uplifting (e.g., “I’m glad I was able to help”), and some are more downbeat (e.g., “I’ll never be able to do this”). Some are accurate (e.g., “I said the wrong thing and upset someone”), and some are less so (e.g., “I’m completely useless”). However, thinking can also cause problems by making us worry, dwell on things and criticise ourselves. It’s common to feel distressed or overwhelmed by our thoughts at times. In fact, problems such as anxiety and depression have a lot to do with how we think. Fortunately, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is very good at targeting the unhelpful thoughts – and the patterns of thinking – that cause these problems. This online workshop will discuss some of the unhelpful thinking patterns we can experience and will offer strategies for reframing our unhelpful thoughts.

Title: State organs' activities on social media | University of Westminster
Info: In recent years, there has been a huge rise in ‘twiplomacy’, that is, the use of social media as a means of direct diplomatic communication by states. This panel, chaired by Dr Marco Longobardo, debates whether and to what extent international law governs state organs' statements on social media. In particular, the panel will discuss whether social media posts by states can contribute, directly and in themselves, to the creation or alteration of customary international law, and whether they can be seen as form of recognition. Featuring Professor Alessandra Annoni and Professor James Green, the discussion will focus on whether there is anything inherently unique about a post on social media that would mean it should be discounted, in principle, as being a potential ‘building block’ for customary international law formation or as a form of recognition. Several related questions will be addressed, such as whose social media interactions (and from which account/s) may be relevant, authenticity and account hacking fears, and the ‘throwaway’ nature of social media interactions themselves.

Title: The World as Abyss: Interrogating the Negative Turn | University of Westminster
Info: The is hosting an afternoon workshop and evening public discussion to celebrate the launch of The World as Abyss: The Caribbean and Critical Thought in the Anthropocene (Pugh and Chandler, University of Westminster Press 2023). The event is co-organised with Jonathan Pugh (University of Newcastle) and Thomas Dekeyser (Royal Holloway, University of London). This event is free, but you will need to register for the workshop sessions in advance by emailing David Chandler at . This event will be followed by the book launch and reception for The World as Abyss: The Caribbean and Critical Thought in the Anthropocene. Copies will be available to purchase for £10 (cash only). This event takes place at the 5th Floor meeting room, 32–38 Wells Street, London W1T 3UW. In this session, we examine the recent emergence of 'the negative' as a problem for geographical critique. The negative has an extensive history in geographical thought, with early Marxist geographers keen on exploring what it might mean to take Marxist-Hegelian negative dialectics seriously. More recently, however, geographers have started engaging negative thought beyond its initial Marxist interpretation. On the one hand, we are witnessing a heightened interest in particular kinds of negative spaces (eg Pohl, 2021), affects (eg Wilkinson and Ortega‐Alcáza, 2019) and politics (eg Kanngieser and Beuret, 2017). On the other hand, on a more explicitly conceptual level, geographers are tackling negativity head-on as a useful problem-space for (re)theorising central geographical concepts, from 'worlds' (Dekeyser, 2022) and 'space' (Kingsbury and Secor, 2021) all the way down to 'subjectivity' (Harrison, 2009; Rose, 2021) and 'affect' (Bissell, 2022). The result is that negativity is increasingly understood as a wide-ranging but internally differentiated concern for geographical thought. But why now? The central questions we want to explore in this session is: what are the ontological, political, social and/or cultural conditions enabling the surge of interest in negativity? Why negative space(s) now? Introductions: This session seeks to explore what is at stake in paraontology. For some authors the world of ontology, of the symbolic, of being, is the graspable and instrumentalisable world of modernity, therefore there is a desire to problematise, challenge, disrupt, move beyond, end or abolish this ‘world’. Perhaps key to discussion of negative ontologies is their relationship to ‘the world’ and what it would mean to imagine being ‘outside of’ or ‘against’ the world. Karera argues that (for Nahum Chandler) ‘blackness poses radical questions about ontology’ whereas other theorists ‘begin from the bewildering conceit that blackness puts ontology radically into question’. (p.183) What does this mean? Perhaps Karera points towards Blackness as a weak link in the chain of signification of the symbolic realm through which the world becomes meaningful. Blackness perhaps works in the same way as Queerness, according to Edelman, as a necessary projection of otherness to a world of the (Lacanian) subject suborned to modernist spacetime. Thus ‘blackness’ or ‘queerness’ do not name literal people or modes of being nor are they prejudices or ideological fictions (p.14), they lack being but are essential to the coherence of the world of being. This figurative positionality is a construct or fictional projection but can be claimed as a positionality of radical critique.

Title: How to Tackle Stress and Worry 30-minute workshop - access any time during Mental Health Awareness week | University of Westminster
Info: The theme for this year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is Anxiety. The Mental Health Foundation has found that anxiety is one of the most common mental health problems that we can face. But, what is anxiety and how can we tackle it? The human ability to ‘think ahead’ means that we can anticipate problems, and it allows us to plan effectively. As ‘thinking ahead’ can help us to achieve our goals, it can be seen as adaptive. Worrying, however, can quickly turn into unhelpful ‘thinking ahead’. To worry means to think about problems that might happen in a way that leaves you feeling anxious or apprehensive. Worry is experienced as a chain of thoughts and images which can progress in increasingly catastrophic and unlikely directions. It is often experienced as uncontrollable and seems to take on a life of its own. This 30-minute, practical pre-recorded workshop brought to you by Westminster Talking Therapies will share strategies to overcome stress and worry using Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). It will give you tips on how to differentiate between helpful and unhelpful worries, and how to tackle them. It will be available to view for the entirety of Mental Health Awareness Week. If you are interested in this workshop, please contact for further information and to gain access.

Title: Men and masculinities in contemporary China | University of Westminster
Info: This event is hosted by the . To gain a nuanced understanding of changing gender dynamics and issues of hierarchy and injustice in gendered practices, research on the diversity and complexity of masculinities and manhood in relation to women and femininities is critical to the broader field of gender studies. While studies of men and masculinities have previously been relatively scarce in Chinese studies, emerging scholarship since the new millennium has signalled an increasing awareness of the complexities surrounding the construction of contemporary masculinities. This panel will explore the increasing multiplicities of men’s identities and practices, including the various ways in which men contest and consolidate 'conventional' notions of masculinity, so as to further deconstruct and subvert the 'natural' link between masculinity and patriarchy. Continuing the Contemporary China Centre Conference's Deconstructed series, it brings together international experts to discuss theories, experiences, performances and representations of men and masculinities in contemporary China. Chaired by Professor Harriet Evans from the University of Westminster, it aims to facilitate public debates on different aspects and iterations of masculinities and contribute new perspectives on the production of gender difference and hierarchy in China.

Title: The disappearance of the public intellectual in apocalyptic times | University of Westminster
Info: Join us for the Inaugural Professorial lecture by Professor Radha D'Souza. We live in times of perpetual crises: the climate crises, immigration and human displacement crises, nuclear wars, pandemics, bank collapses, job losses, disappearing biodiversity and much else. The expanding size and scale of these crises create ever-present anxieties about yet another impending apocalyptic event that could engulf our lives at any moment. Drawing on her academic work, legal practice and social justice activism over the decades Professor Radha D’Souza will examine the reasons for the disappearance of the public intellectual in these apocalyptic times and the ramifications of it for the future. She will contrast the role of the public intellectual in European modernity, which is contingent on the existence of a ‘public sphere’, with the intellectual spaces in pre-modern non-European societies for those who oriented their knowledge towards the future of society and people. Her lecture will highlight the urgent need for social spaces that can sustain real intellectual freedoms that can shift the focus of knowledge beyond power to restoring the capacities for self-rule and self-determination of people. The event will be followed by a drinks reception in the Regent Street foyer. This event takes place in Fyvie Hall, 309 Regent Street, London W1B 2HW

Title: Effective Governance and the Political Economy of Coordination book launch | University of Westminster
Info: This event was organised by the and . A discussion about the future inter-relationships between governance, policy and academic research. The book provides a novel conceptual and methodological approach to evaluating the effectiveness of governance and policymaking. As is presented, the approach, inspired by and drawing from the Austrian and Bloomington Schools of political economy, is applicable to a broad range of complex socio-economic challenges. Discussants: “This book is admirable both in the interdisciplinary range and depth of analysis in the work. It recognises the  challenges of achieving a desired rather than an unintended change and argues cogently for dynamics of co-ordination that allow for fluid and flexible discovery of the best options and paths forward.” - Gerry Stoker, Professor, University of Southampton, UK “This is an extremely valuable and rare contribution to debates about effective governance structures. It provides a well-balanced though critical assessment of arguments about the qualities of different governance arrangements that properly engages all sides and perspectives.” - Mark Pennington, Professor of Department of Political Economy, King's College, University of London, United Kingdom “Dan Greenwood’s Effective Governance and the Political Economy of Coordination brings together a variety of perspectives in political science and political economy in order to develop a novel approach to thinking about problems of governance. His emphasis on openness, discovery, and learning is an important and welcome reminder of how governance systems can be improved when we don’t shy away from the challenges associated with using policy to solve complex problems.” - Jayme Lemke, Senior Research Fellow, Mercatus Centre, George Mason University, USA This book provides a conceptual and methodological approach for researchers evaluating governance and policy in the face of complexity, and demonstrates the application of this approach across different governance and policy contexts. It fills a significant gap in the literature on governance, and proposes a theoretical focus on coordination to enable the assessment of multi-tier, cross-sector governance institutions and policy. It also introduces a range of applications for the proposed approach, including two case studies of governance and policy for the built environment and health services. The book introduces, analyses and draws from a range of perspectives in political economy, political science, policy analysis and evaluation. It also engages with longstanding debates in political economy about states and markets, which are largely overlooked by political science analyses of coordination challenges in governance. The book will appeal to scholars and students of governance, public policy and political science.

Title: Global Diasporic Chinese Museums Network Initiative Public Talk Series - Talk One | University of Westminster
Info: Museum has become a vital platform of making and preserving diasporic heritage, articulating identities and negotiating the relationship between diasporas and the homeland. This talk first outlines the emerging landscape of diasporic Chinese museums around the world.

It argues for the value and urgency of developing a global network as a platform for open and interdisciplinary dialogue between academics and museum professionals on this important but so far under-studied topic. By initiating and facilitating dialogues across geographic and national boundaries, the project seeks to generate new insight on the research and practice of diasporic museum and heritage in the diasporic Chinese context and beyond. This is the opening talk of a public talk series on diasporic Chinese museums organised as part of a project titled “Diasporic Chinese Museums Network Initiative’ funded by AHRC. It is led by Dr. Cangbai Wang (University of Westminster) and Dr. Yow Cheun Hoe (Nanyang Technological University) together with Dr. Huimei Zhang (Nanyang Technological University).

The book includes visual testimonies and prison writings from those falsely accused of inciting the Bhima Koregaon violence, by student leaders opposing the new discriminatory citizenship law passed in 2020, and by activists from the Pinjra Tod's movement. In bringing together these voices, the book celebrates the courage, humanity and moral integrity of those jailed for standing in solidarity with marginalised and oppressed communities. Silencing and punishing critical voices is a project that lies at the heart of Narendra Modi's authoritarian regime in India. The BJP's political dream is clear: to achieve the ethno-nationalist aim of an exclusively 'Hindu' India, while targeting anyone who dares to question or dissent. In this unique book, Suchitra Vijayan and Francesca Recchia look at the present of India through the lived experiences of political prisoners. Combining political and legal analysis with firsthand testimonies, the book explores the small gestures that constitute resistance inside and outside jail for the prisoners and their families, telling a story of destruction of institutions and erosion of rights. In this event, Suchitra Vijayan and Francesca Recchia, authors of How Long Can the Moon Be Caged? Voices of Indian Political Prisoners, will introduce the book. This will lead into responses from Dr Kalpana Wilson, Dr Stavit Sinai and Dareen Tator and finally a Q&A from the audience. The book launch will be followed by a wine reception.

Title: Screening Eugenics: How Theories of 'Racial Fitness' Shape Our Views | University of Westminster
Info: Join us for a thought-provoking in-person event, as we delve into the impact of 'Racial Fitness' theories. Unlike the fronts of yesteryear, when eugenics, the "science of better breeding," relied most heavily on public health and public education platforms to disseminate information, it now thrives most virulently through popular television, film, music, advertising, and social media. Eugenic theories related to transmittable traits for crime, morality, intelligence, and poverty, continue to inform how we frame aspects of life such as masculinity, patriotism, womanhood/motherhood, beauty, and social fitness. This talk will be delivered by award-winning historian and journalist Dr Shantella Sherman. We will examine the shifts of eugenic theories from the laboratory to our living rooms and their presence in some of our favourite shows from Orphan Black and Top Boy, to Coronation Street and Happy Valley.

Title: Historical Racial Trauma: A Roadmap from the Past, Present, and Future | University of Westminster
Info: Join us for an eye-opening online event where we'll explore racial trauma, how it affects us and how we can manage it moving forward. The effects of racism encompass racial abuse, racial trauma, and racial battle fatigue, and can manifest intergenerationally across multiple generations. Historical trauma is the “cumulative emotional and psychological wounding over a lifespan and across generations, emanating from massive group experiences” (Brave Heart, 1998). Any people whose culture has a history of oppression or genocide may experience the effects of trauma handed down generationally. History, as it relates to the Black experience, is a common thread that connects ancestral traumatic experiences to present-day historical events that have occurred across our lifespan, and we often use history as a metaphoric map or timeline that guides those experiences toward our future. However, there is a noticeable disparity in historical awareness of racism between Black and white communities. White individuals often show little historical knowledge of racism in isolated incidents and systemic manifestations of racism. Therefore, their lack of knowledge and understanding of racism from the past strongly suggests a lack of knowledge and understanding of racism in the present day, and provides a foundation for denial and inaction about injustice. This phenomenon helps perpetuate historical racial trauma among Black people. Dr Norwood will discuss how racial trauma affects us, and how we can work together to manage it. Dr Norwood holds a PhD from the University of Birmingham, Edgbaston and specialises in racial microaggressions and historical racial trauma. She has delivered workshops and webinars across the UK on varying topics within the framework of historical racial trauma, racial battle fatigue, and anti-racism training. Dr Norwood has presented to diverse audiences in the US and British academia, private sector organisations, and charities. She has provided anti-racism training at several UK universities including the University of Birmingham, the University of Surrey, the University of Sheffield, and the University of Sussex. Most recently, Dr Norwood appeared as an invited guest panellist at the University of Westminster’s “Challenging Racisms: Welcome & Intersections of Black and Female Academia.” Her most recent publication is a qualitative study that explores supervisor relationships with minority ethnic post-graduate researchers. Dr Norwood is a certified life coach and PhD mentor to minority ethnic students. She uses her academic knowledge and lived experiences to mentor and support post-graduate researchers and students. Currently, Dr Norwood is a Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham. Prior to her academic career, Carlette had an extensive corporate background in the fields of travel, tourism, and hospitality, with previous Executive/Directorship roles in meetings/events, and conference and tradeshow management.

The panel will reflect on the scholarly legacy of Professor Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz, who passed away on 29 September 2022 at the age of 103. A former member of the UN International Law Commission, the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, and the Institut de Droit International, Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz shaped the research and practice of international law until the very end of his life, when in 2017 he published his last monograph. His publications have focused in particular on the legal personality of states, international organisations, international courts and tribunals, the rights of states, and state responsibility. He was a prolific author who influenced research in these fields by publishing in English, French, and Italian. One year after his death, this panel aims to reflect on the impact of Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz’s scholarship on the development and the future of international law. While remembered by Italian academia in a series of events and publications, internationally, his death and legacy received less coverage.

This pre-recorded workshop is available from Wednesday October 11th 2023 for a week.

Resistance for re-democratisation: Building differential solidarities Westminster Forum, Fifth Floor 32–38 Wells Street London W1T 3UW Papia is a political scientist and public policy expert who works on the intersectionality between gender, language, education, and urban living in culturally diverse societies. Recently she started working on the politics of knowledge and decoloniality in the Global South and has joined the Urban Institute at the University of Sheffield as a British Academy Visiting Fellow. Her research focuses on India's multicultural politics and turn to majoritarianism. She teaches at the Centre for Political Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University. New Delhi. She held fellowships at Rhodes University South Africa (2015-2018), University of Edinburgh (2016), Brown University (2015), Fribourg University (2013) and the Shastri-Indo Canadian faculty fellowship at Queens University, Kingston (2007). Her first monograph, "Language as Identity in Colonial India: Policies and Politics", was published in 2018, and she recently published an edited volume "Critical Sites for Inclusion in India's Higher Education". She is the co-applicant in a British Academy project on COVID-19 and its impact on South Asia, and her recent paper on the pandemic and the need for critical communication in urban cities has attracted quite a lot of attention, with being interviewed by The Guardian newspaper. She has published in national and international journals such as Economic and Political Weekly, Social Action, Social Change, International Journal of Multilingualism, Geoforum and International Journal on Diversity.

She is active in community work and regularly talks about academic freedom, federalism in India, education policy and human rights, and women in foreign policy research. Her project at the Urban Institute, Reclaiming through Resistance, interrogates the marginalization of Muslim women in post-colonial India who have faced negligence from the state and their own community. Muslim women's lives, bodies and clothing have increasingly become the arena of conflict between the state and the patriarchal groups who continue to suppress their identity as individual citizens capable of making their own choices. Deploying the intersectionality approach to urban resistance, the project focuses on Muslim women analyzing the case of the anti-CAA protest in India. The project maps Muslim women's everyday experiences of othering, deprivation and alienation and charts out how state action and policies have created or significantly contributed to these vulnerabilities.

Title: Climate and Energy Policy Lab: Lunch Event | University of Westminster
Info: International Politics of Energy Resources: A Materiality Approach? Energy resources play a critical role in international politics, contributing to social, economic and political conflict and cooperation. The conventional International Relations approaches to the study of energy focus on certain political effects or outcomes of the politics of energy. These include on how it can cause conflict and war; how it determines the behaviour and interaction between states and companies; and how it contributes to empire and neo-colonialism. The materiality approach differs from these approaches by taking a different starting point. It examines the physical and material attributes of different energy sources and how these change and transform themselves through the production cycle from exploration, production, transportation, processing and consumption. This materiality approach gives power and agency to energy resources as non-human objects and demonstrates how these physical resources co-create and co-determine social, economic and political reality. This materiality approach will be illustrated through a case-study of oil. The Climate and Energy Policy Lab is an exciting new unit run by climate change and energy policy experts at the University of Westminster. The Climate and Energy Policy Lab Academic Coordinator is Dr Wojciech Ostrowski - Room UG05, 309 Regent Street, London W1B 2HW

Title: Global Diasporic Chinese Museums Network Initiative Public Talk Series - Talk Three | University of Westminster
Info: Museums as Bridges of Understanding: The Bahay Tsinoy Experience 构建理解之桥：以菲华历史博物馆的经验为例 The talk will be given in English. Simultaneous translation into Chinese is provided. Considering what is happening now in our part of Southeast Asia, it is more crucial now, more than ever, to distinguish the Tsinoys (our term for the Chinese in the Philippines) from the new immigrants from mainland China. This talk revolves around the role Bahay Tsinoy plays against this backdrop. The existence of the museum itself as a repository of the historical and cultural legacy of the Chinese in the Philippines showcases the plural diversity of Philippine society. Beyond the physical museum, the myriad ways of reaching out to the public act as a bridge of understanding and acceptance between the Tsinoys (Chinese Filipinos) and mainstream Filipinos. This is the third talk of a public talk series on diasporic Chinese museums organised as part of a project titled ‘ ’ funded by AHRC. It is led by (University of Westminster) and (Nanyang Technological University) together with (Nanyang Technological University). The event is jointly organised by (Hub On Migration, Exile, Languages and Spaces) at the University of Westminster and the of Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

Title: The MONUSCO Intervention Brigade at Ten | University of Westminster
Info: We'll explore the impact that ten years of MONUSCO Intervention Brigade had on the protection of civilians in DRC and on peacekeeping. In 2013, the UN Security Council created an Intervention Brigade in the framework of its mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, MONUSCO. The Intervention Brigade was tasked by the UN Security Council to target and neutralise armed groups in the Eastern part of the DRC, and to promote the stabilisation of the country. Although this was the first offensive unit ever deployed by the UN in the framework of a peacekeeping mission, the UN Security Council affirmed the Intervention Brigade was created on an exceptional basis, had no precedential value, and would not have undermined the established principles of peacekeeping. After ten years of its continued deployment and active participations in military operations in the DRC, the Intervention Brigade raises a number of important legal issues about how it contributed to the protection of civilians and stabilisation of DRC, and on whether it radically changed the UN approach to peacekeeping. Many doubt that ten years of this experiment can be considered exceptional and with no precedential effect. This roundtable will discuss some of these questions. Speakers will provide an appraisal both on the work of the Intervention Brigade in DRC (with specific reference to stabilisation, protection of civilians, and protection of women) and on how it has influenced the development of peacekeeping in general. Coffee and tea will be available from 5pm. This event will take place online and in-person. If you're attending in person, the location is Room 2.05A, .

Info: The University of Westminster is pleased to host the British Association for Applied Linguistics/Cambridge University Press Seminar “Language and Onward Migration: Bridging Applied Linguistics with Migration Studies” on 13 and 14 February 2024. The seminar will explore how languages shape the migration trajectories and experiences of onward migrants (OMs), that is, people whose life courses involve staying in two or more destination countries for extended periods, and, conversely, the effects that onward migration has on OMs’ linguistic repertoires. The aim is to engage in an interdisciplinary conversation as scholars working in Applied Linguistics with academics working in Migration Studies to critically reflect on the affordances, limitations, and possibilities that can come from working together across traditional disciplinary boundaries. The seminar will offer a much needed platform for scholars in applied linguistics and migration studies to develop their knowledge of and skills in two methodological approaches to the study of the language and (onward) migration nexus: The invited speakers will participate in two ‘in conversation’ sessions and lead two methodology workshops. The seminar programme will have space for 12 paper presentations. We invite abstracts for 20 minute presentations (maximum 400 words) that explore how OMs are (un)able to mobilise all the different forms of language that they acquire and develop during their life courses across physical and digital environments to: We are also interested in how OMs’ linguistic repertoires are linked with experiences of racism, xenophobia, and other types of discrimination, as well as precarisation, deskilling, and downward occupational mobility, as well as how repertoires are linked with positive migrations experiences, including, but not limited to, senses of belonging, community building, achievement, and advancement in life. If a high number of high-quality abstracts are received, a poster session will be included in the seminar programme. Please submit your abstracts alongside your full name and affiliation via email to the organisers by 1 November 2023: Notifications of acceptance will be sent out before 30 November.

Title: Mad, Bad, or Possessed? Perceptions of Self-Harm and Mental Illness in Christian Religious Communities  Engaging with Story Completion as a Qualitative Method | University of Westminster
Info: In this talk, Dr Christopher Lloyd will present qualitative data to explore perceptions of self-harm in the context of Christian faith communities. Mental illness within Christian communities may be stigmatised, with many attributing it exclusively to demonic possession, lack of faith, personal sin, or other negative spiritual influences. In this talk, Christopher will present qualitative data which used the novel story completion task to explore perceptions of self-harm in the context of Christian faith communities. In doing so, Christopher will highlight the need for psychology to engage directly and proactively with religious and spiritual belief systems. Methodologically, the talk aims to demonstrate the utility of a seldom-used tool within psychology  – the story completion task – for accessing sociocultural discourses and wider representations surrounding stigmatised topics or populations. Open to all Social Sciences staff and students. Round the Green Table in Psychology, 6th Floor – Copland Building, New Cavendish Street.

Title: Climate and Energy Policy Lab: Lunch Event | University of Westminster
Info: The Climate and Energy Policy Lab is an exciting new unit run by climate change and energy policy experts at the University of Westminster. Climate assemblies are an unprecedented development in climate governance, bringing everyday citizens selected by democratic lottery into the process of designing climate policy. The French Citizens’ Convention for the Climate established by President Macron in 2019–2020 was a catalyst for a wave of climate assemblies across Europe – most at the local level, but with a number of other national governments and parliaments organising assemblies. Permanent climate assemblies have been established in Brussels and Milan and non-governmental organisations, including RSPB, WWF and National Trust, have commissioned independent assemblies to inform their campaigning work. XR and other radical social movement organisations demand more empowered citizens’ assemblies to respond to the climate and ecological emergency. What is behind this wave of climate assemblies? How much impact have they had? What can we hope for climate assemblies in the future? If you have any questions about the event, please feel free to get in touch with the Climate and Energy Policy Lab Academic Coordinator, , at . Join us at , room 350.

Title: Writers' Block Party | University of Westminster
Info: If you're an aspiring writer, you're likely familiar with this scenario: You eagerly prepare to put pen to paper, whether it's the pages of a new Moleskine notebook or the glow of your laptop screen. Your chosen beverage, be it a Diet Coke or hibiscus tea, is at hand. And then, a void descends. You find yourself staring at the unforgiving emptiness of the blank page, contemplating the myriad pathways that might lead to an inspiring story. Yet, for a while, not a single word graces the canvas of your imagination. As writers, words are our tools, our medium for expressing the myriad thoughts and emotions that course through our minds. We strive to convey our messages with both precision and artistry. If you've ever experienced this peculiar form of creative paralysis, we extend an invitation to our Writer's Block Party. Whether you spell it "Writers' Block" or "Writer's Block," it doesn't matter; you're warmly welcomed. As part of our university-wide Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) initiative, we're reaching out to writers from marginalized backgrounds. Join us for an experimental workshop that blends the written word with music, culinary delights, and enlightening speakers.

Title: Southwest China (and how it fell out of academic fashion) | University of Westminster
Info: Since the 1980s, southwest China has enjoyed considerable attention from academics, including a particular focus on representations and everyday practices relating to the many “ethnic minorities” within this region. While importance theoretical tools, such as Louisa Schein’s notion of Internal Orientalism, have subsequently emerged, recent years have seen a decline in the profile of southwest China within English-language academia. This panel seeks to account for this decline, as well as suggest new ways of thinking about and doing research in Southwest China, in an attempt to refocus academic and wider public attention upon this region. This panel continues the Contemporary China Centre Conference Deconstructed format, bringing together international experts to present their own research on southwest China, as well as discuss how this research on the southwest can contribute more broadly to the interdisciplinary field of Chinese studies. The event is free to attend and open to all. A Zoom link will be provided to all those who register before 4 December 2023. (University of Westminster) will Chair this event.

Url: https://www.westminster.ac.uk/events/launch-of-entrepreneurship-research-group-and-speaker-event
Title: Launch of Entrepreneurship Research Group and speaker event | University of Westminster
Info: Professor Christos Kalantaridis, Dean of Westminster Business School, will present his paper co-authored with Merle Kuttin, Multi-dimensional Time and Innovation Ecosystems: A Critical Realist View of the Accumulated Literature to launch the new Entrepreneurship Research Group. This event will take place in the Marylebone building in C280. Time constitutes a relatively overlooked dimension of innovation ecosystems, despite the considerable growth of scholarly attention that they received during the past twenty years or so. This is despite the fact that the eco prefix, that differentiates this body of research from earlier systemic (regional, national and sectoral) approaches, highlights the interdependency among actors and the co-evolution that binds them together over time. In response, our paper sets out to develop a coherent framework for the conduct of temporal analysis of innovation ecosystems. This draws on critical realism and is used to decipher existing research and shape the research and policy and practice agenda. Our critical realist framework offers observers of innovation ecosystems the intellectual tools needed in order to decipher actors and actions, and shapes an emergent agenda for future temporal studies. We create a designed intellectual construct that is, however, mostly bare of contents. This impacts adversely our ability to draw implication for policy and practice.

Title: Machine Listening | University of Westminster
Info: Legal Otologies | Hear Law Sound is a series of virtual residencies at the Westminster Law and Theory Lab, Westminster Law School, University of Westminster, hosted by Julia Chryssostalis and Dr Danilo Mandic. The residencies provide a platform through which to examine the ear in law – its structures, functions, practices, lexicons and locations – and more generally the legal register of the aural and the auditory in its relation to sound. Established in 2020 by artist-researchers Sean Dockray, James Parker, and Joel Stern, is a platform for collaborative research and artistic experimentation, focused on the political and aesthetic dimensions of the computation of sound and speech. The collective works across diverse media and modes of production. In addition to research, , and , Machine Listening have produced an expanded , conceived as an experiment in collective learning and community formation; an online and ; numerous on-and-offline ; and, a browser-based for composing with audio and video via text. The programme will be in two parts: a workshop and a listening session, both led by James Parker of the Machine Listening collective. All are welcome, for one or both sessions. You open a dataset, click on a file and hear a person cough three times. You click on another one, hear a voice counting from one to twenty. You notice an accent but you can’t place it. The next file is labelled ‘oooo.wav’, and the one after that ‘YAF_voice_sad.wav’ What are these recordings? Why were they made? What can they tell us about the datasets of which they are a part, and their uses? In this experimental workshop, participants will listen to datasets as sites of both power and possibility, critique and creativity. Moving between conversation and a series of listening tests, we will consider how auditory datasets are compiled, stored, and processed, and how different modes of listening might reveal a world of social relations embedded within. Commissioned for the exhibition (RMIT Design Hub), Environments 12 is a new, speculative addition to the once-popular Environments series: a sequence of 11 released between 1969 and 1979 that anticipated a mass-market in mood-altering nature recordings. The work takes the form of a multi-channel audio installation, presenting a world in which the environment itself has been updated. In this world, the reproduction, synthesis and management of soundscapes has become ubiquitous and planetised. Loudspeakers and microphones are laced through the biosphere, all in the name of a cybernetic ecology. Unfolding across a series of historical, contemporary, and speculative scenes, the work is narrated by an ensemble of vocal performers and their generative voice clones. Together, this more-than-human chorus tells and retells stories of ‘psychologically ultimate seashores’, reef lullabies, natural symphonies designed for zoo enclosures, and large language models for whales and crows. A collection of songs and fables recovered from the ruins of a future history. Soho Poly, 4-12 Little Titchfield Street, London W1W 7BY

Title: Copy me, copy you: Investigating the development of facial mimicry in infancy | University of Westminster
Info: Dr Carina De Klerk from University of Essex offers a talk and results presentation. Round the Green Table in Psychology, 6th floor of the Copland building, New Cavendish Street Campus Open to all Social Sciences staff and students. Facial mimicry, the tendency to spontaneously and unconsciously copy others’ facial expressions, plays an important role in social interactions, yet its ontogeny is still debated. In this talk Dr Carina De Klerk will present the results of two studies that test the hypothesis that sensorimotor experience is critical in the development of facial mimicry. The first study showed a relationship between mothers’ tendency to imitate their 4-month-olds’ facial expressions during a parent-child interaction session and the infants’ tendency to mimic others as measured by electromyography (EMG). Maternal facial imitation was not related to infants’ mimicry of hand actions, and instead found preliminary evidence that infants’ tendency to look at their own hands may be related to their tendency to mimic hand actions. However, because this was a correlational study in which infants’ sensorimotor experience was not manipulated, it does not provide conclusive evidence for the idea that correlated sensorimotor experience plays a causal role in supporting mimicry. Additionally, as this study did not measure motor cortex activation, it is unknown how the observed facial mimicry related to activation of the corresponding motor representations in the brain. In the second preregistered study, we are systematically manipulating infants’ experience with their own facial actions by giving 4-month-olds two weeks of daily sensorimotor experience with their own facial actions via a toy mirror, while infants in the control condition play with the same toy without the mirror. Before and after this intervention, we measure infants’ facial mimicry using EMG and their sensorimotor cortex activation using electroencephalography (EEG) while they observe videos of other infants’ facial actions. We predict that infants who receive a greater amount of correlated sensorimotor experience with their own facial actions will show greater sensorimotor cortex activation and greater facial mimicry during the observation of others’ facial actions. Data collection for this study is nearly finalised (N=98 participants tested so far), and the results will be presented in the talk. The use of complementary methods (EMG and EMG) allows us to obtain an objective measure of facial mimicry (EMG), as well as a measure of the neural correlates underlying it (EEG). Together these studies provide insight into the role of correlated sensorimotor experience in the development of facial mimicry, contributing to the ongoing debate regarding its ontogeny.

Title: From grind to growth: Creating sustainable wellbeing in performance environments | University of Westminster
Info: Dr Peter Olusoga from Sheffield Hallam University offers a talk on how and why the grind culture and the pursuit of “wellness” can be ultimately damaging to our mental health and how we might move away from the grind, towards more sustainable ideas of growth and well-being. Round the Green Table in Psychology, 6th floor of the Copland building, New Cavendish Street Campus Open to all Social Sciences staff and students. According to the global wellness institute, the extremely poorly defined construct of wellness is worth up to £2.8 trillion worldwide. The individual and organisational focus on wellness (very often conflated with the slightly more robustly defined concept of well-being), is not going away any time soon. Unfortunately, the rise of the Instagram influencer and Tik-Tok guru has left the pursuit of psychological well-being as a potentially evidence-sparse endeavour. This, together with the pervasive “grind culture” which promotes productivity and achievement as the path to personal well-being, has created a culture in which burnout and associated mental health issues are on the rise.

Title: Perceptions and meta-perceptions in the context of intergroup contact | University of Westminster
Info: Dr Sofia Stathi from the School of Human Sciences at University of Greenwich offers a talk investigating how people’s thoughts and concerns regarding the ingroup and the outgroup relate to intergroup contact. Round the Green Table in Psychology, 6th floor of the Copland building, New Cavendish Street Campus Open to all Social Sciences staff and students. In the existing intergroup relations literature, there is substantial focus on how to improve people’s attitudes toward outgroups via intergroup contact. Most relevant research has considered contact as the starting point of subsequent relations, with less emphasis on understanding the factors that promote or inhibit engagement in intergroup contact. This talk outlines a programme of research on how people’s (meta-)perceptions predict (or are associated with) contact experiences. Specifically integrating pluralistic ignorance and meta-perception premises and apply them to intergroup relations and dehumanization research.

Title: Transitions and belonging in higher education: duck to water, or fish out of water? | University of Westminster
Info: Julie Hulme, Professor of Psychology Education in the School of Social Sciences at Nottingham Trent University, will explore ways in which we can help diverse students to successfully navigate transitions, and to develop a sense of belonging and social support at university. Round the Green Table in Psychology, 6th floor of the Copland building, New Cavendish Street Campus Open to all Social Sciences staff and students. The transition to university is often described as a challenging or difficult time, with the literature focusing on the transitional experience as a single episode, and often drawing generalised conclusions about specific 'disadvantaged' groups. In this talk, Professor Julie Hulme will draw upon her own research to reflect on the diversity of transitional experiences, and explore whether it is helpful to 'problematise' transitions, or to consider them as a normal part of the student (and human) life experience. We will explore some practical implications of the findings to reflect on ways in which we can help diverse students to successfully navigate transitions, and to develop a sense of belonging and social support at university.

Info: Cases on Entrepreneurship and Diversity will be launched by guest speaker Professor David Rae, Professor of Enterprise De Montfort University. L195 on the Marylebone Campus Why do intercultural creativity and entrepreneurship matter? How can they help in placemaking? Ideas and examples from Leicester and other places. The presentation is based on the chapter in the book, ‘Cases on Entrepreneurship and Diversity’. It explores how Leicester has developed as an intercultural creative economy. The main focus is on the development of intercultural entrepreneurship, based on the diverse ethnic microcultures which settled in Leicester and the ways in which their activities burgeoned in the creative economy and social spaces, enabling innovation and the urban transformation from a monoculture before 1972 to the highly diverse city of today. This convergence of interculturality enabled Leicester to become energized through intercultural entrepreneurship, creating a unique international identity, and attracting students, migrants and entrepreneurs worldwide. Despite Lockdowns in the COVID Pandemic during 2020-21, Leicester is now a globally branded city, known for its distinctive ethnic, food, music, costume, festivals and sporting cultures. This chapter was co-authored with Sudesh Sangray.
